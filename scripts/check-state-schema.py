Validate `.claude/features/*/state.json` files against the canonical schema.

Canonical schema rules (enforced at write time via the pre-commit hook):

1. **SCHEMA_DRIFT** — use `current_phase`, not the legacy `phase` key.
   Surfaced by the 2026-04-21 structural meta-analysis (2 of 40 files used
   the legacy key); both since migrated.
2. **PR_NUMBER_UNRESOLVED** — if `phases.merge.pr_number` is set, verify the
   PR resolves via `gh pr view`. Closes Gemini audit Tier 1.2's
   "integrate with sources of truth" recommendation at write-time rather
   than only post-hoc on the 72h integrity cycle. Skipped gracefully if
   `gh` is unavailable (CI without GH_TOKEN, offline dev, etc.).
3. **PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG** (Phase 1a, added 2026-04-24) — if
   `current_phase` changes vs the committed state.json, require a matching
   `phase_started` / `phase_approved` event in the feature's contemporaneous
   log file within `PHASE_EVENT_FRESHNESS_MIN` minutes. Promotes Tier 2.2
   contemporaneous logging from Class B (agent-dependent, silent gap) to
   Class A (mechanically enforced).
4. **PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING** (Phase 1b, added 2026-04-24) — if
   `current_phase` changes, require `timing.phases[OLD].ended_at` +
   `timing.phases[NEW].started_at` to be present and non-null. Promotes
   Tier 1.1 per-phase timing from narrative to mechanical.

Usage:
    scripts/check-state-schema.py                    # scan all state.json files
    scripts/check-state-schema.py <path> [<path>...] # validate specific files
    scripts/check-state-schema.py --staged           # validate git-staged files

Exit codes:
    0  all validated files pass all checks
    1  one or more files violate a check (message on stderr)
    2  usage error or missing file

Bypass (emergency only): `git commit --no-verify`. The 72h integrity cycle
still catches any drift introduced through bypass.
