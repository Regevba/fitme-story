## 3. New gates inventory since anchor

| Gate category | 2026-04-21 | 2026-05-22 | New |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Write-time pre-commit gates | 4 (T1) | 8 (T1) | BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION (Mode B+C), FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS, CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6, CU_V2_INVALID, STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK, STATE_OWNER + LOCATION_MISMATCH |

Totals (per CLAUDE.md "Data Integrity Framework"): 18 → 37+ mechanical gates, 0 → 5 advisories.

## 4. Anchor §16 limitations — status

Per spec §4:

| # | Anchor limitation | Phase 1 response | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sample size n=41 | n=83 (full corpus) | **CLOSED** |
| 2 | No framework-version cohort comparison | L1 NEW §17 | **CLOSED** |
| 3 | No cross-repo split FT2↔fitme-story | L1 NEW §18 | **CLOSED** |
| 4 | Gemini audit then-pending | Folded into L1 §17 as v7.0→v7.5 inflection | **CLOSED** |
| 5 | Self-referential bias (same author) | Anchor #2 (external auditor) is the closure | OPEN (Phase 3 reconciliation) |
| 6 | No statistical significance testing | n still too small per cohort | OPEN (will close at n=200+) |
| 7 | No reader-comprehension validation | Not in Phase 1 scope | OPEN (deferred) |

Plus 2 case-study-level meta-analyses (predate anchor but worth re-flagging): [`meta-analysis-full-system-audit-v7.0-case-study.md`](../meta-analysis-full-system-audit-v7.0-case-study.md), [`meta-analysis-audit-and-remediation-case-study.md`](../meta-analysis-audit-and-remediation-case-study.md).

## 6. Where to go next

- [L1 — Extended cohort analysis](2026-05-22-l1-extended-cohort-analysis.md) — the main analytical work, replicates anchor §1-§16 + 2 new dimensions
- [L2 File A — Audit-prep claim ledger (auditor-facing)](2026-05-22-l2-audit-prep-claims-v7-9-1.md) — staged into Audit #2 claude-bundle on 2026-06-08
- [L2 File B — Internal sidecar](2026-05-22-l2-internal-sidecar.md) — working notes, NEVER staged externally
