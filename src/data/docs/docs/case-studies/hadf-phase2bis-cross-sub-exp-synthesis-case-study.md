# HADF Phase 2-bis — Cross-Sub-Exp Synthesis Case Study

> **Status:** DRAFT skeleton authored 2026-05-27 (Phase E Day 6) as Block C task C16 pre-work. Sections are pre-structured with TBD markers; the operator populates each as the sub-exp verdicts land. **The pre-ceremony skeleton exists to ensure the synthesis is mechanical-not-creative at Block C closure** — every section's analytical structure is fixed before the data lands, eliminating after-the-fact narrative drift.
>
> **Authoritative spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-hadf-phase2bis-replication-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-hadf-phase2bis-replication-design.md) — full requirements, threat model, acceptance criteria, and per-sub-exp design live there.
>
> **Predecessor:** [HADF Phase 2 — Cloud Fingerprinting Measurement](./hadf-phase2-cloud-fingerprinting-case-study.md) (shipped 2026-05-01, silhouette 0.5566 at k=5, n=700 across 2 endpoints).

## §1 What's measured (3 sub-experiments + 1 synthesis)

Per spec §1, three sub-experiments answer three orthogonal research questions about the HADF dispatch premise:

| Sub-exp | Research question | Endpoints | Schedule | Primary metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sub-exp 1 | Does the silhouette signature reproduce on cloud endpoints beyond OpenAI direct? | 9 cloud (6 providers) | 5 fires/day × 3 days × 9 endpoints × 50 calls = 6,750 nominal | Silhouette score at k=5 ≥ 0.5 |
| Sub-exp 2 | Can we distinguish Ollama-on-M2 from cloud endpoints by signature alone? | 1 (Ollama llama3.2:3b) | 5 × 3 × 1 × 50 = 750 nominal | KS-distinguishability p < 0.01 |
| Sub-exp 3 | Does AWS Bedrock haiku-4-5 fingerprint differently from Anthropic-direct haiku-4-5? | 3 (2 anchors + 1 Bedrock target) | 5 × 3 × 3 × 50 = 2,250 nominal | Signature delta ratio > 2.0 |
| Synthesis (this case study) | Overall HADF dispatch claim status across the 3 verdicts | n/a | n/a | confirmed / refuted / inconclusive |

**Total nominal records across all 3 sub-exps:** 9,750. **Total expected valid:** ~5,600. **Total cost:** ~$5 expected, $20 ceiling. **Total wall-clock:** ~15 days (9 collection + ~6 buffer).

### Sub-exp 1A vs 1B note (per Sub-exp 1 locked prereg's `launch_matrix_narrowing`)

Sub-exp 1 launched 2026-05-25 with a **narrowed 4-endpoint matrix** (openai gpt-4o-mini + gpt-4o + anthropic claude-haiku-4-5 + claude-sonnet-4-6) instead of the originally-specified 9 endpoints. Operator decision 2026-05-25: 3 endpoints excluded (gemini-2.5-flash/pro for reasoning-model TTFT distortion; vercel-ai-gateway/mistral/xai for placeholder API keys not yet minted). Sub-exp 1B is queued as a successor run after key acquisition + reasoning-model investigation to exercise the full 9-endpoint matrix.

**Implication for this synthesis:** Sub-exp 1 verdict in §3.A reflects 1A's 4-endpoint data; Sub-exp 1B (if it runs before Block C closure) is treated as an additional data point per §3.A.1 below.

## §3 Per-sub-exp verdicts (populated as each sub-exp closes)

### §3.A Sub-exp 1 — Cloud generalization

**Verdict:** **PASS** (verdict-script run 2026-05-28T03:15Z interim n=2200 → final n=2600 after Day-3 fires; disarm 2026-05-28T~13:30Z post-final-fire 11:00Z)

**Pre-registered pass criteria** (per [`preregistration-phase2bis-subexp1.json`](../../.claude/shared/hadf/preregistration-phase2bis-subexp1.json) `verdict_thresholds`):

- `pass_silhouette_min`: 0.5 (Phase 2 baseline: 0.5566)
- `pass_yield_min`: 600
- `fail_clusters_lt`: 3

**Observed values** [T1] (from [`scripts/hadf-phase2bis-verdict.py`](../../scripts/hadf-phase2bis-verdict.py) `--raw-dir /Volumes/DevSSD/hadf-sub-exp-1a-backups --subexp subexp1`):

| Metric | Threshold | Observed | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Silhouette at best_k | ≥ 0.5 | **0.7003** | ✅ PASS (+0.20 over threshold; +0.144 over Phase 2 baseline 0.5566) |
| best_k value | n/a | 5 | n/a (matches Phase 2 k=5) |
| n_valid total | ≥ 600 | **2,600** | ✅ PASS (4.3× threshold) |
| cluster_count at best_k | ≥ 3 | 5 | ✅ PASS |
| cluster_endpoint_purity | ≥ 0.8 | Not measured by verdict v1 | n/a (deferred to Block C synthesis if cluster-vs-endpoint purity needed for §5 status) |

**Per-endpoint summary** [T1] (14 fires × 4 endpoints × 50 calls = 2,800 dispatched; 2,600 valid; 200 dropped uniformly across all 4 endpoints — one bad fire equivalent at 2026-05-25T16:40:34Z window before harness hardening Fix #1 settled):

| Provider | Endpoint | n_dispatched | n_valid | Median TTFT (s) | Median TPS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | 700 | 650 | 0.0296 | 49.64 | Phase 2 baseline endpoint — TTFT consistent with Phase 2 |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o | 700 | 650 | 0.0163 | 99.54 | Fastest TTFT in matrix; ~2× the TPS of gpt-4o-mini |
| Anthropic | claude-haiku-4-5 | 700 | 650 | 0.9181 | **152.93** | Highest median TPS in matrix |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4-6 | 700 | 650 | 1.3800 | 67.98 | Slowest TTFT + lowest haiku/sonnet TPS ratio |
| **TOTAL** | | **2,800** | **2,600** | | | 92.86% valid rate |

**Cost actual:** $0.3240 (sum of `phase2bis-cost-log.jsonl` `estimated_cost_usd` over 12 fires logged; 14 fires fired but the first 2 fires predate cost-log enablement) [T1]. Spec §2 nominal for Sub-exp 1 was $3-4 for the full 9-endpoint matrix; actual on 4-endpoint narrowed matrix = ~10% of nominal, well under the $15 per-sub-exp ceiling.

**Collection window:** 2026-05-25T16:36:44Z → 2026-05-28T11:11:14Z (~2.8 days wall-clock, 14 fires) [T1]. Disarm 2026-05-28T13:34Z (`launchctl bootout gui/$UID com.fitme.hadf-phase2bis-subexp1.plist`, post-verdict). 1 additional fire skipped vs spec §4 nominal `5 × 3 = 15` (the 03:15Z verdict landed PASS at 4.3× yield threshold; remaining 15:00Z/19:00Z/23:00Z fires were no-op compute).

**Kill criteria check** [T1]:

| Kill criterion | Observed | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `n_valid < 300` (prereg) | 2,600 | ✅ Not tripped (8.7× threshold) |
| All endpoints simultaneously rate-limited > 2 fires consecutively | 0 rate-limit events observed across 14 fires | ✅ Not tripped |
| ANY endpoint changed streaming protocol or model id mid-collection | All 4 endpoints stable across 14 fires | ✅ Not tripped |
| Wrapper preflight failed 3+ times consecutively | 14/14 fires preflight Check A (worktree venv) = ok | ✅ Not tripped |

**Trip-wires** [T1]:

| Trip-wire | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `cost_overrun_3x` | $0.324 actual vs ~$4 nominal = 0.08× | Not tripped |
| `anchor_drift` | Applies to subexp3 only | n/a |

**Interpretation** [T3]: The Phase 2 single-endpoint signature (silhouette 0.5566 at k=5 on openai/gpt-4o-mini, n=700) reproduces across multiple providers and **strengthens** with broader matrix — silhouette improves to 0.7003 (+25.8%) on the 4-endpoint cloud matrix, with 5 distinct clusters separating the endpoints by streaming-latency fingerprint. The signature is not openai-specific. **Cloud generalization confirmed within the 4-endpoint scope** — Sub-exp 2 (cloud-vs-local separability) is unblocked.

The 200-record uniform drop (50/endpoint) traces to the 2026-05-25T16:40:34Z fire window that ran before harness-hardening Fix #1's worktree-local venv settled across the wrapper; subsequent 12 fires were clean (validated by heartbeat ledger `preflight=ok` flag).

#### §3.A.1 Sub-exp 1B v2 (updated 2026-05-31)

**Lifecycle to date:**

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 (Sub-exp 1A close) | 5 endpoints originally deferred from Sub-exp 1A: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro (reasoning-model TTFT distortion), vercel-ai-gateway gpt-4o-mini, mistral-large-latest, xai grok-4-1 (placeholder API keys) |
| 2026-05-30 (PR #533) | Sub-exp 1B v1 prereg shipped with 4-endpoint cloud matrix (anthropic anchor + google non-reasoning gemini-2.5-flash-lite + mistral-large-latest + vercel-ai-gateway gpt-4o-mini). xAI deferred. Reasoning-model concern resolved via Google rotation to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (verified 0 thoughtsTokenCount at HADF-scale prompts) |
| 2026-05-30T07:46:24Z | Sub-exp 1B v1 prereg LOCKED at sha256=`cfc7e968feeb`; signed tag `prereg-phase2bis-subexp1b-locked-2026-05-30` pushed to origin |
| 2026-05-30T07:47:03Z | Sub-exp 1B v1 Fire 0 (manual jumpstart): 200 records dispatched, **114/200 OK** — anthropic 50/50 + google 50/50 clean; mistral 9/50 (41× HTTP 429 free-tier RPS); vercel-ai-gateway 5/50 (45× HTTP 429 "Free tier requests on this model are rate-limited. Upgrade to paid credits") |
| 2026-05-30 ~08:01Z | Operator decision: BOOT-OUT launchd. Plist preserved at `~/.fittracker/deferred-plists/com.fitme.hadf-phase2bis-subexp1b.plist.deferred-2026-05-30`. Fire 0 data preserved + `.v1-rate-limited-partial` archive suffix |
| 2026-05-31 (PR #542) | **Sub-exp 1B v2 scope reduction** — drop mistral + vercel-ai-gateway; ship 2-endpoint design (anthropic + google) for 2026-06-10 earliest launch |

**v2 design (per [`preregistration-phase2bis-subexp1b.json`](../../.claude/shared/hadf/preregistration-phase2bis-subexp1b.json) at this PR — pending re-lock after merge):**

- Endpoints: 2 (anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 + google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
- Primary metric: silhouette score at k=2 (v1 was k=5)
- expected_yield_threshold: 150 (v1 was 300)
- pass_yield_min: 300 (v1 was 600)
- fail_clusters_lt: 2 (v1 was 3)
- earliest_start_date: **2026-06-10**
- Cost estimate: ~$0.12 (Anthropic only; Google free at scale)

**Deferred from v2 (vs v1):** mistral/mistral-large-latest + vercel-ai-gateway/gpt-4o-mini. Revival paths: (A) upgrade plans, (B) per-call throttle in collect.py, (C) continued deferral. Detailed rationale in v2 prereg `deferred_endpoints` block + this case-study §6.

**Verdict:** TBD (populate ~2026-06-13 after 3-day Sub-exp 1B v2 collection closes). Per-endpoint table will be appended to §3.A above; secondary metrics §3.A.1.B (anchor drift vs 1A) + §3.A.1.G (google class validation — first non-Anthropic + non-OpenAI provider) populated at verdict time.

### §3.B Sub-exp 2 — Cloud-vs-local separability

**Verdict: PASS** (closed 2026-06-02; collection 2026-05-30T04:50Z → 2026-06-02T02:00Z, 18 fires, cost $0; verdict artifact [`phase2bis-subexp2-verdict.json`](../../.claude/shared/hadf/phase2bis-subexp2-verdict.json)). Computed against the lock-intact prereg (sha256 `d4ec4680…`, lock sidecar verified).

**Pre-registered pass criteria** (per [`preregistration-phase2bis-subexp2.json`](../../.claude/shared/hadf/preregistration-phase2bis-subexp2.json) `verdict_thresholds`, operator-confirmed at the 2026-05-30 lock ceremony — **LOCKED at sha256=`d4ec4680ef21`** via signed tag `prereg-phase2bis-subexp2-locked-2026-05-30`):

- `pass_ks_p_max`: **0.01** (per spec §1 RQ2)
- `pass_yield_min`: **250** (kill floor `n_valid < 200`; nominal-valid expectation 375)
- `fail_if_ks_p_greater_than`: 0.05

**Observed values** [all T1 — instrumented from raw `.jsonl`]:

| Metric | Threshold | Observed | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| n_valid Ollama | ≥ 250 (kill floor 200) | **800** / 900 dispatched (88.9% valid) | ✅ PASS |
| KS p — **TTFT** vs openai/gpt-4o-mini | ≤ 0.01 | KS=0.9362, p ≈ 0 (< 1e-300) | ✅ |
| KS p — **TTFT** vs anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 | ≤ 0.01 | KS=0.9812, p ≈ 0 (< 1e-300) | ✅ |
| KS p — **TPS** vs openai/gpt-4o-mini | ≤ 0.01 | KS=0.7492, p = 7.39e-273 | ✅ |
| KS p — **TPS** vs anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 | ≤ 0.01 | KS=0.9100, p = 9.88e-324 | ✅ |
| Ollama median TTFT | n/a | 0.179 s | n/a |
| Ollama median TPS | n/a | 43.84 tok/s | n/a |

**Full distribution summary** (2-sample comparison; Ollama n=800, each anchor n=1300) [T1]:

| Endpoint | TTFT_s min / p25 / med / p75 / max | TPS min / p25 / med / p75 / max | TPS std |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ollama** llama3.2:3b (M2, local) | 0.140 / 0.147 / **0.179** / 0.227 / 5.005 | 23.1 / 32.8 / **43.8** / 45.1 / 46.2 | **6.9** |
| openai/gpt-4o-mini (cloud) | 0.000 / 0.001 / **0.021** / 0.055 / 32.2 | 0.3 / 46.2 / **65.4** / 102.1 / 3984.2 | 277.2 |
| anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 (cloud) | 0.594 / 0.909 / **1.099** / 1.417 / 34.7 | 6.3 / 66.4 / **83.3** / 152.9 / 27638.2 | 951.2 |

**Interpretation** [T3]: Local execution produces a streaming signature **distinguishable from both cloud anchors at p ≪ 0.01 on both TTFT and TPS** — the hypothesis (RQ2) is confirmed. Two structural features carry the separation: (1) **TTFT** — Ollama's 0.179 s median sits cleanly between openai's near-instant 0.021 s (edge-served, no model-load latency) and anthropic's 1.099 s; the local 3B model has no network round-trip but a real prompt-eval step, landing it in its own band. (2) **TPS variance** — Ollama's throughput is tightly clustered (std 6.9, almost the entire mass in 32–45 tok/s), whereas both cloud endpoints show extreme variance (openai std 277, anthropic std 951) driven by short-output tok/s inflation and multi-tenant scheduling jitter. A local M2 inference loop is *consistent* in a way cloud serving is not, and that consistency is itself a fingerprint. **Cloud-vs-local separability confirmed → Sub-exp 3 (the routing falsification test) is unblocked** (gated separately on AWS Bedrock access).

### §3.C Sub-exp 3 — Routing test (the central HADF claim)

**Verdict:** TBD (populate ~2026-06-05 after B15.5 verdict-script run). Verdict script `scripts/hadf-phase2bis-verdict.py --metric signature_delta_ratio` shipped via PR #539 (2026-05-31, in CI at this PR's open time); ready when Sub-exp 3 collection closes.

**This is the FALSIFICATION test for the central HADF dispatch claim.** Same model id (`anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5`) served by 2 providers (Anthropic-direct + AWS Bedrock); if signatures differ enough to clear within-provider noise floor → HADF dispatch premise holds; if indistinguishable → HADF refuted on this metric.

**Pre-registered pass criteria** (per [`preregistration-phase2bis-subexp3.json`](../../.claude/shared/hadf/preregistration-phase2bis-subexp3.json) `verdict_thresholds` — **pre-ceremony scaffolding on main; operator locks at B15 ceremony after AWS Bedrock model-id verification + .env.local SHA256 capture**):

- `pass_signature_delta_ratio_gt`: **2.0** (per PR #534 prereg scaffolding; operator may revise at lock)
- `fail_signature_delta_ratio_lt`: **1.0** (inconclusive band: 1.0–2.0)
- `pass_yield_min`: **600** (3 days × 5 fires × 3 endpoints × 50 calls/fire = 2,250 expected; 600 = ~27% floor)
- `pass_silhouette_min_k3`: **0.4** (secondary metric — 3 distinct clusters across openai-anchor + anthropic-direct + bedrock)
- `anchor_drift_max_sigma_for_pass`: **4.0** (vs Sub-exp 1A's openai/anthropic anchors)

**4 trip-wires** (per #534 prereg): `anchor_drift_subexp1a` + `anchor_drift_subexp1b` (now applies to v2 anthropic distribution per §3.A.1 above) + `cost_overrun_3x` (~$1 expected; pause at $3) + `bedrock_serverless_cold_start_bias` (Bedrock cold-start adds TTFT noise; methodology caveat).

**AWS Bedrock model id**: PLACEHOLDER in prereg + ENDPOINTS["subexp3"] — operator replaces with verified dated form (`aws bedrock list-foundation-models --by-provider anthropic --region $AWS_REGION`) before lock per [`operator-actions-subexp3.md`](../../.claude/features/hadf-phase2bis-replication/operator-actions-subexp3.md) §3.

**Observed values:**

| Metric | Threshold | Observed | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| signature_delta_ratio (Bedrock vs Anthropic-direct haiku-4-5) | ≥ pass_signature_delta_ratio_min | TBD | TBD |
| Bedrock median TTFT | n/a | TBD | n/a |
| Bedrock median TPS | n/a | TBD | n/a |
| Anthropic-direct (this run) median TTFT | n/a | TBD | n/a |
| Anthropic-direct (this run) median TPS | n/a | TBD | n/a |
| Within-Anthropic intra-provider variance (Sub-exp 1 reference) | n/a | TBD | n/a |
| Anchor drift (Sub-exp 1 → Sub-exp 3 anchors) | KS p ≥ pass_anchor_drift_p_value_min | TBD | TBD |
| n_valid total | ≥ pass_yield_min | TBD | TBD |

**Verdict logic** (3 outcomes per Sub-exp 3 prereg `_verdict_logic_note`):

| Delta ratio range | HADF claim status |
|---|---|
| > 2.0 | **Confirmed** — Bedrock haiku clearly outside Anthropic-direct's noise floor → routing produces distinguishable signatures |
| 1.0 ≤ ratio ≤ 2.0 | **Inconclusive** — may need higher-n run or different metric |
| < 1.0 | **Refuted on this metric** — Bedrock + Anthropic-direct indistinguishable within Anthropic's intra-provider noise |

## §4 Anchor drift analysis (Sub-exp 1 → Sub-exp 3)

**KS-test p-value comparing Sub-exp 1's anchor distributions vs Sub-exp 3's anchor distributions:**

- openai/gpt-4o-mini Sub-exp 1 vs Sub-exp 3: TBD
- anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 Sub-exp 1 vs Sub-exp 3: TBD

**Trip-wire status:** TBD (per Sub-exp 3 prereg `trip_wires.anchor_drift`). If KS p < 0.01 for either anchor, append methodology note here describing the drift magnitude + impact on Sub-exp 3 routing verdict confidence. Do NOT halt — drift is methodology, not invalidation.

**`scripts/hadf-phase2bis-anchor-drift-check.py` output:** TBD — capture verbatim at synthesis time.

## §5 Overall HADF dispatch claim status

**Synthesis verdict:** TBD — populate ONLY after all 3 sub-exp verdicts + anchor-drift check are in.

Decision matrix:

| Sub-exp 1 | Sub-exp 2 | Sub-exp 3 | Synthesis |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | PASS | PASS (delta > 2.0) | **HADF dispatch claim CONFIRMED** — cloud generalization + local-vs-cloud separability + routing-distinguishability all met |
| PASS | PASS | INCONCLUSIVE (1.0 ≤ delta ≤ 2.0) | **HADF dispatch claim PARTIALLY SUPPORTED** — cloud + local separable, but same-model-different-provider routing inconclusive; queue follow-up |
| PASS | PASS | REFUTED (delta < 1.0) | **HADF dispatch claim REFUTED on routing axis** — cloud signatures separable BUT same-model-different-provider routing produces no distinguishable signature; revise claim |
| PASS | FAIL | n/a (Sub-exp 3 doesn't launch) | **HADF dispatch claim PARTIALLY SUPPORTED** — cloud generalization confirmed but local-vs-cloud separation not on this metric; document scope limitation |
| FAIL | n/a | n/a (downstream sub-exps don't launch) | **HADF dispatch claim CANNOT be confirmed by this measurement** — cloud signature did not reproduce beyond Phase 2's openai-direct baseline; document scope limitation + Phase 2 result stands alone |

**Observed combination:** TBD

**Synthesis verdict:** TBD

**Implications for ORCHID v2 design stub** (per external-audit-3 scope 2026-08-05): TBD — depends on synthesis verdict. If CONFIRMED, ORCHID v2 can claim routing-tier signature as a dispatch input. If REFUTED, ORCHID v2 dispatch logic on the routing axis must be revised or removed.

## §6 Methodology notes (per-sub-exp deviations + cross-sub-exp observations)

TBD — captured at synthesis time. Include:

- Any trip-wires that fired (didn't abort but flagged): anchor_drift, cost_overrun_3x, ollama_thermal_anomaly, bedrock_haiku_version_drift
- Any prereg field changes between draft (PR #506/#507) and lock (operator ceremony): list each `_TBD_at_ceremony` field's final value + rationale
- Any operator narrowing decisions (like Sub-exp 1A's 9→4 narrowing): document + provide forward-pointer to Sub-exp 1B follow-up runbook
- Cost actuals vs spec §2 nominal (Sub-exp 1 $3-4 + Sub-exp 2 $0 + Sub-exp 3 $1 = $4-5 nominal)
- Wall-clock actuals vs spec §4 (15 days nominal: 9 collection + 6 buffer)
