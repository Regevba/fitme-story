# FitMe — Product Management Lifecycle Skill

**Date written:** 2026-04-02

> A data-driven, AI-orchestrated product management system built as a Claude Code skill.  
> Automates the full feature lifecycle from research to production with gated approvals, UX research, design system compliance, and post-launch metrics review.

**Try it:** `/pm-workflow {feature-name}` in any Claude Code session with this repo.

## What It Does

Every feature — whether a 1-day fix or a 3-week build — follows the same disciplined, data-driven lifecycle:

```

Every arrow is a **gate** — the user must approve before proceeding.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Research Before Building
Phase 0 forces you to understand what exists, compare 2-3 alternatives, and validate your approach with data before writing a single line of code or PRD.

### 2. Data-Driven at Every Level
Every feature PRD requires 10 mandatory metrics fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Primary metric | The one number that defines success |
| Secondary metrics | Supporting signals |
| Guardrail metrics | Things that must NOT degrade |
| Leading indicators | Early signals (within 1 week) |
| Lagging indicators | Long-term impact (30/60/90 days) |
| Instrumentation | How we measure |
| Baseline | Current value before launch |
| Target | Success threshold |
| Review cadence | When to check |
| Kill criteria | When to revert or rethink |

**No PRD is approved without complete metrics.** No exceptions.

### 3. UX Research + Principles
UI features start with UX research before design:
- Applicable principles (Fitts's Law, Hick's Law, progressive disclosure)
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- External best practices research
- Design inspiration with documented reasoning

### 4. Living Design System
The design system is a **living, evolving framework** — not a static constraint.

When a feature's design doesn't align with the current system, the compliance gateway presents three options:
1. **Fix** — comply with the current system
2. **Evolve** — update the design system on the feature branch (merges with the feature)
3. **Override** — proceed with documented justification

Since every feature is on its own branch, there's zero risk to main.

### 5. Branch Isolation + Parallel CI
Large features get isolated `feature/{name}` branches. Before merge:
- CI must pass on **both** the feature branch and main
- High-risk files (encryption, sync, auth, AI) get extra scrutiny
- Parallel diff review identifies risks and gaps

### 6. Post-Launch Accountability
Features don't end at merge. The lifecycle includes mandatory post-launch metrics review at the cadence defined in the PRD. Features that don't deliver value get iterated or killed.

## System-Wide Guardrails

Every feature must not degrade these metrics:

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Crash-free rate | > 99.5% |
| Cold start time | < 2s |
| Sync success rate | > 99% |
| CI pass rate | > 95% |
| Cross-feature WAU | Trending up or flat |

## How It Works

### Start a new feature
```
/pm-workflow push-notifications
```

### Resume an in-progress feature
```
/pm-workflow push-notifications
```
The skill detects existing state and resumes from the current phase.

### Check active features
Active features are shown automatically when you start a session:
```
## Active Features
- push-notifications: phase=implementation
- food-search: phase=prd
```

## Live Dashboard

See the development pipeline in real-time: **[FitMe Development Dashboard](../../dashboard/)**

Built with Astro + React + Tailwind v4. Features:
- **Kanban board** with drag-drop (dnd-kit) — 8 columns from Backlog to Done
- **Table view** with sort/filter/search (@tanstack/react-table)
- **Pipeline overview** — stacked bar chart of feature distribution
- **Reconciliation engine** — cross-source conflict detection (9 tests)
- **Dark mode** — system preference + localStorage toggle
- **Responsive** — desktop, tablet, mobile breakpoints

*The dashboard itself was the first feature built end-to-end using `/pm-workflow` — dogfooding the full lifecycle as it existed at that point in the framework’s evolution.*
