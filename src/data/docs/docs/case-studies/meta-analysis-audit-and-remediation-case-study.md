## 2. The Story in Three Acts

### Act I — The Audit (2026-04-16)

After 18 case studies, 6 v2 screen refactors, and a framework that had grown from v1.0 to v7.0, we asked a question that hadn't been asked before: *what's actually broken?*

The answer came from a 4-layer risk-weighted parallel sweep:

```
Layer 1 — Surface Sweep (6 parallel domain agents)
  AI Agent       → 6 files    → 20 findings
  Backend Agent  → 37 files   → 35 findings
  DS Agent       → 125 tokens → 15 findings
  Tests Agent    → 21 files   → 30 findings
  Framework Agent → 69 files  → 20 findings
  UI Agent       → 143 views  → 25 findings
         ↓
Layer 2 — Deep Dive (risk-weighted targeting)
  DEEP-AUTH series  → 15 root-cause findings
  DEEP-SYNC series  → 13 root-cause findings
         ↓
Layer 3 — Cross-Reference (18 prior case studies)
  9 recurring, 2 regressions, 4 predicted, 5 new categories
         ↓
Layer 4 — External Validation
  21 findings (11.4%) confirmed by build/test/wc-l
```

**185 findings. Health scorecard: 16.2/100 (F).**

The scorecard was brutal but honest. It exposed three systemic patterns that no individual feature case study had caught:

1. **Fabrication-Over-Nil** — Every AI adapter fabricated plausible data instead of returning nil. Every recommendation since launch was computed from partially invented inputs. The three-tier architecture worked perfectly — on fabricated bands.

2. **Dual-Sync Race** — CloudKit and Supabase both pull on login with no merge coordination. `lastPull` advances past decryption failures, permanently skipping failed rows. `needsSync` guards existed for weekly snapshots but not daily logs.

3. **Review-Mode Auth Bypass** — `applyReviewSessionIfNeeded()` had no `#if DEBUG` fence. Any production binary receiving the right environment variable would authenticate as the developer.

### Act II — The Plan (2026-04-16)

The 185 findings were triaged into 63 tasks across 9 phases, ordered by severity × effort ratio:

| Phase | Priority | Tasks | Findings | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | IMMEDIATE | 4 | 7 | Critical security & crash |
| 2 | HIGH | 7 | 18 | AI fabrication-over-nil |
| 3 | HIGH | 14 | 22 | Sync & data integrity |
| 4 | HIGH | 10 | 16 | Auth & encryption hardening |
| 5 | MEDIUM | 9 | 20 | Design system tokens |
| 6 | MEDIUM | 11 | 30 | Test coverage |
| 7 | MEDIUM-LOW | 4 | 10 | UI structure & cleanup |
| 8 | LOW | 4 | 10 | Framework config hygiene |
| 9 | FUTURE | — | 7+ | Large-effort deferred |

The plan's architecture: phases 1–4 address every critical and high-severity finding. Phases 5–8 are mechanical cleanup. Phase 9 requires separate sprints (server-side WebAuthn, dual-sync coordinator, dark mode tokens).

### Act III — The Fix (2026-04-17)

Two sessions. Two PRs. 78 findings resolved.

**PR #84** (Phases 1–4, 8): 7 commits, 20 files changed, 51 findings resolved.

**PR #85** (Phases 5, 7): 2 commits, 8 files changed, 27 findings resolved.

Every commit built successfully. Every commit passed all 231 tests. One test required updating (it relied on the fabricated `trainingDaysPerWeek` that Phase 2 eliminated).

## 3. What Changed — Phase by Phase

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Crash (7 findings)

| Fix | Impact |
|---|---|
| `#if DEBUG` fence on `applyReviewSessionIfNeeded()` | Production binary can no longer be tricked into developer auth |
| `timeout.cancel()` in `restoreSession()` nil branch | Eliminates double-resume crash risk |
| Remove dead `generateNonce()`/`sha256()` + stale import | Reduced attack surface, cleaner binary |
| `LocalEmailAuthProvider` already fenced (verified) | No change needed — audit finding confirmed existing protection |

### Phase 2: AI Fabrication-Over-Nil (18 findings)

The root cause: adapter methods used non-optional return types, so when data was missing, they fabricated sentinels instead of returning nil.

| Adapter | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| ProfileAdapter | `genderIdentity = "prefer_not_to_say"` | `genderIdentity = nil` |
| ProfileAdapter | `trainingDaysPerWeek = DayType.allCases.filter(\.isTrainingDay).count` | `trainingDaysPerWeek = profile.trainingDaysPerWeek` (actual) |
| ProfileAdapter | `dietPattern = "standard"` | `dietPattern = nil` |
| HealthKitAdapter | `stressLevel() → "moderate"` when no log | `stressLevel() → nil` when no log |
| HealthKitAdapter | BMI from `startWeightKg` fallback | BMI only from measured weight |
| NutritionAdapter | `mealsPerDay` counting planned meals | Only counts completed meals |
| TrainingAdapter | `count * 10` duration heuristic | `count * 15` + no fabricated fallback |

Supporting fixes:
- `AnyCodable` now throws `DecodingError` instead of silently defaulting to `""`
- `trainingDaysWeekBand()` handles `case 0` (rest weeks)
- Band extraction makes gender and diet optional — include only when user provided
- `FoundationModelService` placeholder confidence lowered 0.8 → 0.5
- `RecommendationMemory` header corrected ("encrypted" → "plain UserDefaults"), eviction improved to single-pass O(n)

### Phase 3: Sync & Data Integrity (14 findings)

| Fix | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| CloudKit daily log merge | Overwrites local unsaved edits | `needsSync` guard skips remote overwrite |
| `lastPull` advancement | Advances past decryption failures | Stays at oldest failure, re-fetches next time |
| Singleton checksum | SHA-256 of ciphertext (changes per-encrypt) | SHA-256 of plaintext (stable across encryptions) |
| Realtime events | Each event triggers immediate `fetchChanges()` | 500ms debounce coalesces rapid-fire events |
| `fetchAllRecords()` | Full pull on every session change | Full pull only on first login; incremental after |
| `needsSync = false` | Set before `persistToDisk()` | `persistToDisk()` called first |
| Push error handling | Errors silently swallowed | Structured `os.log` logging per failed record |
| Auth session | `try?` silently fails | Explicit error handling with status message |

### Phase 4: Auth & Encryption Hardening (7 findings)

| Fix | Risk Eliminated |
|---|---|
| Simulator calls `setSessionContext(LAContext())` | Encryption works in debug builds |
| Keychain save: update-first, then add-if-missing | No brief window of missing key during save |
| `.biometryAny` replaces `.biometryCurrentSet` | Keys survive fingerprint/face re-enrollment |
| Cancel pending continuation before new Apple sign-in | No continuation leak on rapid re-sign-in |
| Passkey userID: log on decode failure | Diagnostic visibility without crashing |

### Phase 5: Design System Token Compliance (20 findings)

27 deprecated token calls migrated across 6 compiled files:

- **AuthHubView**: 13 calls — `Color.status.*` → `AppColor.Status.*`, `Color.accent.*` → `AppColor.Accent.*`, `Color.appSurface/appStroke/appBlue2` → `AppColor.Surface/Border/Brand.*`
- **MealEntrySheet**: 10 calls — deprecated colors + `.foregroundColor()` → `.foregroundStyle()`
- **MealSectionView**: 5 calls — `Color.status/accent` → `AppColor`
- **MetricCard**: 3 calls in previews
- **RootTabView + BodyCompositionCard**: 3 hardcoded `.font(.system(size:))` → `AppText.iconMedium/iconXL`

### Phase 7: UI Cleanup & Accessibility (3 findings)

- AI thumbs up/down buttons: added `accessibilityLabel("Helpful"/"Not helpful")`
- LockedFeatureOverlay dismiss: added `accessibilityHint("Dismisses the upgrade prompt")`
- LockedFeatureOverlay icon: `.font(.system(size: 40))` → `AppText.iconXL`

### Phase 8: Framework Config Hygiene (5 findings)

- `framework-manifest.json` version → 6.1, description updated
- `cache-metrics.json` got `framework_version` field
- Monitoring entries: inverted timestamp fixed, framework version → 6.1
- Orphaned `v52-dispatch-log.json` deleted

## 4. What Didn't Change (and Why)

### Phase 6: Test Coverage (30 findings — 4 resolved, 26 deferred)

**Resolved (PR #86):**

- **TEST-018**: WCAG opacity test now reads actual `AppColor.Text.tertiary` alpha via `UIColor` resolution instead of hardcoded local constant
- **TEST-020**: Confidence gate test asserts `localFallback.confidence < 0.4` against production `AIRecommendation` instead of pure arithmetic
- **TEST-021**: Quiet hours test calls production `isQuietHour(at:)` with controlled dates. `NotificationService.isQuietHour()` gained a testable `at:` parameter.
- **TEST-030**: `ReadinessEngineTests.makeLogs()` replaced `Double.random()` with deterministic cyclic offsets

**Deferred (26 findings):** 5 high-risk files with zero test coverage (`EncryptionService`, `AuthManager`, `CloudKitSyncService`, `SupabaseSyncService`, `HealthKitService`) require mock infrastructure (URLProtocol stubs, mock Keychain, mock CKDatabase) that doesn't exist yet. This is a separate sprint.

### Phase 9: Large-Effort Items (7+ findings — deferred)

| Item | Why Deferred |
|---|---|
| Server-side WebAuthn verification | Requires Supabase Edge Function deployment |
| Dual-sync coordinator | Architectural decision: sequence or merge? |
| MealEntrySheet decomposition | 1155 lines, 17 @State — full v2 refactor |
| Dark mode token pipeline | ~40% of token categories missing from CI |
| Network mocking infrastructure | Foundation for Phase 6 test coverage |
| XCUITest + Snapshot tests | New test targets, not patch work |

## 6. The Self-Referential Question

This case study documents an unusual loop: the same AI system that built the code also audited it, planned the fix, executed the fix, and is now writing about it.

### What the loop got right

The fabrication-over-nil pattern (Act I, Discovery 1) is the strongest validation. No individual feature case study caught it because each adapter *appeared* to work — it returned data, the orchestrator processed it, the UI displayed a recommendation. The systemic view revealed that the data was invented. The fix (Act III, Phase 2) was surgical: 7 files, 40 insertions, 30 deletions. Every adapter now returns nil when data is absent, and the orchestrator's `insufficientData` path — which existed from Day 1 but was structurally bypassed — finally activates.

### What the loop cannot verify

78 findings were resolved by code changes that build and pass tests. But 146 of the original 185 findings were "framework-only" assertions — plausible from code reading but unverified at runtime. The fixes for these assertions are equally unverified at runtime. The `needsSync` guard (Phase 3) is correct by code inspection, but proving it prevents data loss requires a multi-device sync test under contention — which hasn't happened.

The honest conclusion: the code is measurably better by every static metric. Whether it's *correct* requires runtime validation that this audit methodology cannot provide.

### The bias report in one sentence

This system finds what it knows how to look for (code patterns, token compliance, coverage gaps) and misses what it cannot observe (runtime behavior, real user experience, actual security exploitability).

## 7. Decisions Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D-1 | Execute phases 1–4 first | Severity × effort — highest impact, lowest effort |
| D-2 | Single branch per PR batch | Atomic review — easier to see cohesive fix |
| D-3 | One commit per phase (not per task) | Granular enough for rollback, not so granular as to obscure intent |
| D-4 | Skip Phase 6 entirely | Test coverage requires mock infrastructure that doesn't exist |
| D-5 | Make gender/diet optional in bands | Removing fabrication means these fields are now nil; bands must tolerate nil |
| D-6 | Keep passkey fallback with logging | Hard crash on decode failure would lock users out; logging preserves diagnostics |
| D-7 | Combine audit + remediation case studies | One story told in two documents loses the narrative arc |

## 10. What Comes Next

1. **Sprint C: Test coverage** — Start with AI adapter tests (no mock blocker), then build mock infrastructure for sync/auth/encryption
2. **Sprint D: Server-side WebAuthn** — Supabase Edge Function for passkey verification; dual-sync coordinator architectural decision
3. **Runtime validation** — The 146 framework-only findings need runtime testing to graduate from "plausible" to "confirmed"
4. **Re-audit** — Run the same 4-layer sweep after Sprint C + D to measure scorecard improvement from the F baseline
