## FT2-FH-001 — v7.7 silent-pass on `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6`

**Status:** **CLOSED** in v7.8 (2026-05-02 → 2026-05-03 across PRs #173, #185, #186, #187, #188, #189, #192, #193).

**Original claim** (v7.7 case study, Section 99 / "Outcome at synthesis time" table, published 2026-04-27):

> | `cache_hits[]` post-v6 | 33.3% | **gated to 100% on next write (issue #140 closed)** |

**What the data showed** (T1, instrumented via Python sweep against `.claude/features/*/state.json`, captured 2026-04-30):

- The v7.7 `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6` gate read `state.get("created_at", "")` for its post-v6 cutoff comparison.
- **43 of 46 features (93%)** stored the timestamp under the legacy key `created` instead.
- The gate's first conditional (`created_at < V6_SHIP_DATE`) evaluated `"" < "2026-04-16"` → `True` → early return without finding for those 43.
- The remaining 3 features either had `created_at` set but were not yet at `current_phase=complete`, or had no `cache_hits` key at all (gated by `if cache_hits is None`).
- **Effective gate coverage at the time the v7.7 case study claimed "100% gated" was 0 / 46 features.**

Issue #140 was closed in spec, open in practice.

**Why this matters:** the v7.7 case study was written, peer-reviewed, and shipped while the headline gate had **0% effective coverage**. The framework asserted gate *implementation*; it never asserted gate *execution*. This is the exact failure mode v7.5 was created to prevent.

**Closure path** (v7.8):

1. **PR #169** (2026-05-01) — bulk migration: 43 state.json files renamed `created` → `created_at`. Gate's read path now sees the canonical field.
2. **PR #173** (2026-05-02, by Regev) — Mechanism C scaffolding (`PostToolUse:Read` hook + `scripts/observe-cache-hit.py`) + defensive dual-read `created` ∪ `created_at` + Mechanism-C exemption (`MECHANISM_C_SHIP_DATE`). v7.7 case study Section 99B correction note appended.
3. **PRs #185 + #186** (2026-05-03) — `framework_version` backfill: 39 missing + 6 unprefixed-numeric + 1 misspecified → 46/46 canonical `vX.Y` form. Validation criterion 3 from spec §9 hit.
4. **PR #187** (2026-05-03) — **Mechanism A** (the meta-fix): every write-time gate now emits `{candidates, checked, skipped, skip_reasons}` per run to `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl`. The first event captured on real corpus shows `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6: candidates=47, checked=0, skipped=47` — **the silent-pass evidence captured at the source.** v7.9 promotes `GATE_COVERAGE_ZERO` to enforced.
5. **PR #188** (2026-05-03) — Mechanism C wiring (T9 + T10 + T11): `/pm-workflow` writes `.claude/active-feature`, SessionStart surfaces it, `observe-cache-hit.py` reads it for attribution, new `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INACTIVE` advisory fires when session ledger captures Reads but state.json drifts.
6. **PR #189** (2026-05-03) — Mechanism E git merge driver (`union-dedup-by-key`) auto-resolves append-only ledger conflicts.
7. **PR #192** (2026-05-03) — Schema bridge fields populated on all 47 features; new `path-reducers.json` + `agent-leases.json` registries.
8. **PR #193** (2026-05-03) — Mechanism D (`pre-commit-self-test`) asserts no header drift; Mechanism F (`membrane-status.py`) advisory smartlog.

**Tier tags:** all numerical claims in this entry are T1 (live Python sweep against the corpus, gate-coverage.jsonl captured at v7.8 ship). The 2026-04-30 audit memo + this ledger entry are the source.

**Lessons recorded:**

1. **Don't claim "100% gated" without verifying the gate can fire.** v7.8 Mechanism A makes this structurally observable; v7.9 promotes the meta-check to enforced.
2. **Don't add a gate that depends on a field most features don't use.** v7.8 Mechanism B (dual-read + canonical schema) gives field-rename drift a detection surface.
3. **Memory drift is itself a silent-pass surface.** The 2026-04-30 audit memo was 2 days stale at the start of the v7.8 work session. Several "open" items had already been closed by predecessor PRs. Verifying memory against current code BEFORE starting work is now a documented anti-pattern check.
4. **Continuing to publish IS the trust signal.** Per the publish-then-remediate rule: original v7.7 case study is unchanged on `main`; corrections accrete via Section 99B + this ledger entry. Pattern: curl monthly reports, Postgres release notes, Tailscale.

**Predecessor: none** (this is the first ledger entry).

**Successor: TBD** (next entry will be appended when the next "we got this wrong" surfaces and is closed).

## FT2-FH-002 — v7.8.3 PR-cache-staleness silent-pass

**Filed:** 2026-05-12 (single-session patch v7.8.4)
**Framework version at incident:** v7.8.3
**Framework version at resolution:** v7.8.4

**What we got wrong:** During the 2026-05-12 session-open status check, `make integrity-check` reported **35 findings** (32× BROKEN_PR_CITATION + 2× PR_NUMBER_UNRESOLVED + 1× PHASE_LIE). Every cited PR (#307, #311 in FT2; #93, #95, #97, #98 in fitme-story) was live-verified via `gh pr view` to be MERGED on GitHub. The findings were **100% false positives** caused by an empty `.cache/gh-pr-cache.json` (schema present, `last_refreshed_at: 2026-05-11T17:58Z`, but **0 PRs in both `Regevba/FitTracker2` and `Regevba/fitme-story`** in the cached arrays).

**Root cause:** The v7.8.3 D-3 PR-cite cache (`scripts/refresh-pr-cache.py`) was a deliberate caching layer to avoid hitting the `gh` CLI on every integrity-check run. But the contract was "cache exists" — NOT "cache is fresh AND non-empty." A cache file written with malformed/empty `repos.*.{open,merged,closed}` payloads would still pass `load_pr_cache()`'s existence check, and downstream callers (`audit_case_study_citations`, `_resolve_pr_cite_integrity`) would lookup every cited PR number against an empty array → universal-not-found → BROKEN_PR_CITATION fires for everything.

**Why the silent-pass class repeats v7.7's lesson:** FT2-FH-001 was "gate that depends on a field most features don't use silently passes." This is the same shape with a different victim: a *gate that depends on a cache layer assumed populated silently false-positives when the cache is empty.* In both cases, the gate has full implementation but lacks a coverage-assertion on its own dependency.

**Why this matters:** v7.9's 2026-05-21 promotion decision evaluates criterion #2 ("no false positives") per the [infra master plan](../master-plan/infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) §2.2. If `make integrity-check` is reporting 33 BROKEN_PR_CITATION false-positives on the morning of 2026-05-21, the criterion becomes ambiguous to evaluate. v7.8.4 closes the door before the data freezes.

**Closure (v7.8.4):**

1. **New script `scripts/ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py`** — checks `last_refreshed_at` timestamp AND non-empty payload (`cache_is_empty()` returns True when all `repos[*].{open,merged,closed}` arrays are empty). Refreshes if stale (>24h), missing, or empty. Fail-soft on `gh` unavailability (logs warning, lets downstream proceed).
2. **`Makefile::integrity-check` extended** — auto-invokes `ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py --quiet` before `integrity-check.py`.
3. **`.github/workflows/integrity-cycle.yml` extended** — new `Refresh PR cache (v7.8.4)` step before the integrity-check step. `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` provides API auth; failure logs via `::warning::` annotation but does not abort the cycle.

**Companion v7.8.4 hygiene (in the same patch, NOT separate honesty entries):**

- 5 LOW doc-debt items closed (dual-outlet frontmatter + branch-isolation success_metrics + ios-code-connect case_study_type)
- 6 TIER_TAG_LIKELY_INCORRECT advisories cleared (3 heuristic narrowings + 1 case-study re-tag + 1 reference-ledger pinning)
- 2 CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INACTIVE advisories cleared (cache_hits[] backfill from Mechanism C attribution data)
- Stale `.claude/active-feature` lockfile reset
- First-ever `make snapshot-phase` invocation (sha256-verified backup off-SSD)

**Outcome:** `make integrity-check` baseline went from 35+9 (session open) → **0 findings + 0 advisory** (v7.8.4 ship).

**Tier tags:** T1 (live `make integrity-check` runs across the v7.8.4 session, before/after snapshots captured to `.claude/integrity/snapshots/2026-05-12T07-22-35Z.json`).

**Lessons recorded:**

1. **A cache layer needs a "cache is meaningful" predicate, not just "cache exists."** Empty/stale caches silently false-positive every dependent gate. Future cache-dependent gates should ship with an `is_cache_usable()` check beside the cache-load.
2. **The v7.7 silent-pass class is recurrent.** Different victim (PR cache vs. `created_at` field), same shape (gate depends on something it doesn't assert). The Mechanism A coverage-emission pattern (v7.8) should extend to cache-layer gates next: emit `{cache_age_seconds, entries_loaded}` alongside `{candidates, checked, skipped}`.
3. **Patch-level hygiene releases pay for themselves before promotion windows.** v7.9 makes the 2026-05-21 promotion decision with a 0+0 baseline — every advisory at that moment is real, not noise. Cost: ~2h of work in this session. Cost saved: ambiguity-cost on the promotion criterion #2 evaluation.

**Predecessor:** [`FT2-FH-001`](#ft2-fh-001--v77-silent-pass-on-cache_hits_empty_post_v6) — v7.7 silent-pass on `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6`.

**Successor: TBD.**

## FT2-FH-003 — v7.9 promotion succeeded with no silent-pass; calibration discipline pattern codified

**Status:** **CLOSED** at v7.9 ship (2026-05-21, single-session enforcement-flip on `feature/v7-9-promotion`).

This entry is **not a correction.** It is a recorded discipline: the v7.9 promotion is the first framework-version flip to land with the 4-criterion Mechanism A calibration gate from infra-master-plan §2.2 already met for every candidate. v7.7 shipped a headline claim that turned out to be wrong (FT2-FH-001). v7.8.3 shipped a PR-cache assumption that turned out to be wrong (FT2-FH-002). v7.9 shipped only after the gates being promoted had emitted observed telemetry against the criteria they were going to enforce.

**Decision context** (T1, captured 2026-05-21 from `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl`):

| Gate | 14d rows (2026-05-07 → 2026-05-21) | candidates=0 rows | Skip reasons (all legitimate) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B | 18 | 0 | `not_infra_commit_level` × 13 |
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode C | 13 | 0 | (separate emission key) |
| `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` write-time | 13 | 0 | `not_complete_transition` × 11, `no_phase_change` × 1 |

**The 4-criterion checklist** (per infra-master-plan §2.2; the discipline being codified):

1. **Coverage emitted** — ≥7 days of `{candidates, checked, skipped}` rows in `gate-coverage.jsonl` per candidate. Met: 14 days, 0 zero-candidate rows across all 3 gates.
2. **No false positives** — every `failure` row maps to a legitimate violation in the staged diff (operator review). Met: 0 false-positive findings across the 14d window.
3. **No silent skips** — `skipped` count tracks real reasons (out-of-scope files, exempt tags), not bugs. Met: all `skip_reasons` map to documented legitimate cases.
4. **Reversibility** — advisory mode restorable in <5 min via single-line `BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = True` revert + commit + merge. Verified locally.

**What changed at v7.9 ship:**

| File | Change | LoC |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/check-state-schema.py:132` | `BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = True → False` (single flag drives all 3 gates) | 1 |
| `CLAUDE.md` | New "v7.9 Promotion Release" section + version-chain header update + 2 advisory→enforced annotations | ~50 |
| `.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md` | New cold-start entrypoint | new file |
| `docs/architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md` | §2.4.1 promoted sub-section | ~30 |
| `docs/case-studies/framework-honesty-ledger.md` | This entry | ~70 |
| `docs/case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md` | New case study with B1 outcomes + Phase E calendar | new file |
| `.claude/features/framework-v7-9-promotion/state.json` | Phase research → implement + skip prd + tasks_phase + timing | small |
| `.claude/logs/framework-v7-9-promotion.log.json` | 2 Tier 2.2 log entries (phase_approved + phase_started) | small |

**Discipline being codified** (T2, declarative — verifiable on next promotion):

Every future advisory → enforced promotion must execute the B1-style freeze-day checklist before the flip lands:

1. `make integrity-check` → must report 0 findings
2. `make integrity-diff` → must report no regression vs the pre-window baseline anchor
3. `make documentation-debt` → must report ≤ baseline open count
4. `make measurement-adoption` → capture for the promotion record (snapshot of {features_total, fully_adopted, per-dimension coverage})
5. `python3 scripts/membrane-status.py` → capture
6. Last 14 days of `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` analyzed — per candidate gate, verify (a) ≥7 days of emission, (b) zero candidates=0 rows, (c) all skip_reasons map to documented legitimate cases
7. Per-gate decision recorded in the new framework version's case study + state.json `phases.research.decision` field
8. Single-line flip + side-effects PR opened only after all 6 above are GREEN

Any gate that fails any of the 4 §2.2 criteria stays advisory. Re-evaluation defaults to T+14d after the next attempted promotion window.

**Why this matters** (T3, narrative):

The 2026-04-21 Gemini independent audit's most consequential finding wasn't a specific bug — it was that the framework was shipping mechanisms (gates, advisories, scripts) faster than it was measuring whether those mechanisms actually fired. The v7.5 → v7.8 arc built the measurement infrastructure (Mechanism A coverage ledger, Mechanism C session attribution, Mechanism E merge driver, Mechanism F membrane status). v7.9 is the first promotion that *used* that infrastructure as a gate on its own promotion decision. The next promotion (v7.10 or whenever) will inherit the pattern: no flip without telemetry that the flip is needed and won't break the existing fleet.

The framework now follows the same closure rule as the case-study layer: publish verbatim, then remediate. Mechanism A measures gates the same way case studies measure features. A future framework version that promotes a gate without 7d of Mechanism A data + 0-false-positive evidence + reversibility verified should be treated as a regression in framework discipline — flag it, roll it back, and document the decision in this ledger.

**Tier tags:**

- T1 — the 14d telemetry counts (`{18, 13, 13}` rows from `gate-coverage.jsonl`), the file-change LoC tally, the integrity-check baseline (0 findings, 1 advisory before commit), the per-feature B1 verification outputs.
- T2 — the 4-criterion checklist becoming the canonical discipline for future promotions (declarative; verifiable on the next promotion's adherence).
- T3 — the framework-discipline narrative about why this matters (interpretive synthesis).

**Predecessors:**

- [`FT2-FH-001`](#ft2-fh-001--v77-silent-pass-on-cache_hits_empty_post_v6) — v7.7 silent-pass on `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6` (0/46 effective coverage shipped under a "100% gated" headline).
- [`FT2-FH-002`](#ft2-fh-002--v783-pr-cache-staleness-silent-pass) — v7.8.3 PR-cache-staleness silent-pass (33 false-positive findings on empty cache; closed at v7.8.4 with `PR_CACHE_STALE` auto-refresh).

**Successor:** TBD — depends on Phase E soak outcome. The next entry will be created either (a) at v7.10 promotion (logging that the discipline held), or (b) if Phase E surfaces a regression requiring rollback, an immediate entry capturing what went wrong with the calibration interpretation.
