## 2. The Story in Four Acts

### Act I — The Concurrent Stress Test Premise (2026-04-18, morning)

After Sprint E shipped (PR #94, 2026-04-17), the predecessor case study left an honest "what's still open" table: ~55 audit findings reachable via serial sprints, ~7 deferred to architectural sprints. The natural next move was Sprint F.

But there was a tempting alternative. The framework had grown to v7.0 with HADF (hardware-aware dispatch), parallel write safety, mirror snapshots, and worktree-isolated agent dispatch. None of that had been stress-tested under load. **Could the framework run 6 audit-remediation groups concurrently, each in its own worktree, each landing its own PR?**

The plan: divide the remaining audit work into 6 groups (G1 UI, G2 Tests, G3 AI, G4 Backend, G5 DS, G6 Config), dispatch 6 agents in parallel via `Agent({isolation: "worktree"})`, and let them race to completion. Wave 1 of 3.

Wave 1 dispatched 6 agents at ~12:00. By ~12:12, **5 of 6 had aborted** with permission errors. The G6 agent reported clean refusals (no-op exit), G2 had escaped its worktree and written to canonical paths (contamination), the rest were silent failures. Wave 1 produced no PR.

Salvage: the cleanup agent recovered 4 working test files (1041 lines, 46 cases) from G2's contaminated paths. PR #95 shipped them as "stranded test salvage" — the only artifact of wave 1.

The rest of the day was forensic. Reading agent traces. Reading `.claude/worktrees/*/`. Reading the parent's permission set. The conclusion: the framework's `additionalDirectories` whitelist was path-literal — it didn't compose with worktree-prefixed paths. Every agent that tried to `Edit` or `Write` to `.claude/shared/*` from inside its worktree got denied.

This was **F1 (HIGH)**. The first of nine framework findings.

### Act II — The Pivot to Serial (2026-04-18, afternoon)

The 6-group concurrent stress test wasn't going to run again that day. The serial sprint pattern from A-E (one branch, one PR, ~30-90 min each) had a 5-for-5 success rate. Pivot.

Plan written: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-18-post-stress-test-remediation.md` — 5 serial sprints F-J covering ~54 of the ~55 remaining doable findings. Recommended order: F → I → J → G → H, smallest risk first.

Then the work shipped:

| Sprint | PR | Findings | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| F (Quick wins) | #96 | 7 closed + 4 partial = 11 | ~30 min |
| I (UI/DS small wins) | #97 | 10 | ~45 min |
| J (Test coverage skeleton) | #98 | 3 (with 13 new test cases) | ~45 min |
| G (Backend & sync hardening) | #99 | 5 | ~75 min |
| H (AI pipeline correctness) | #100 | 8 | ~60 min |
| **Total** | **5 PRs** | **37 findings** | **~4.5 h** |

In parallel with sprint shipping, the framework bug findings F1-F7 were filed as a separate spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-framework-bugs-from-stress-test.md`). The audit-v2 wave-1 case study was closed with the failure modes documented (`docs/case-studies/audit-v2-concurrent-stress-test-case-study.md`).

Sprint F-J shipped on the 18th. By end-of-day: 127 → 164 closed (96 → 21 open).

### Act III — The Framework Bug Cycle (2026-04-19, morning)

CI was red on every Sprint G/H/I/J PR not for code reasons but for an unrelated environmental gap: the iOS Simulator's keychain rejected ops with `errSecMissingEntitlement` (-34018) because `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` stripped entitlements. **PR #101** (CI keychain entitlement fix) replaced `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` with ad-hoc signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=-`, `CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO`, `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES`). Main went green for the first time in 5+ sprints.

Then F1 itself.

**PR #102** added two glob entries to `additionalDirectories` matching the worktree-prefixed paths. Verified end-to-end with a single worktree-isolated probe agent that successfully wrote a probe file. **F1 closed (single-agent verified).**

**PR #103** documented F2/F3/F4/F5 as a `worktree_isolation_contract` block in `.claude/shared/dispatch-intelligence.json`:
- F2 — when blocked, never escape worktree (codified contract)
- F3 — worktree settings.local.json is runtime read-only (documented gap)
- F4 — no kernel-level sandbox; agents bound by contract not OS (documented trade-off)
- F5 — `cd <worktree>` and `git -C <worktree>` patterns pre-granted in settings

Plus codified the F6 salvage protocol (when an agent dies mid-write, snapshot to `.build/snapshots/`, branch off main, verify, commit-or-quarantine).

**Wave 2 attempt.** With F1-F5 supposedly closed, the same 5 concurrent worktree-isolated agents redispatched against the same task. **All 5 got `Edit/Write` denied identically to the pre-F1 attempt.** The F1 fix had only covered the directory-level Read access; Edit/Write tool grants are gated separately. **F8 (HIGH)** filed.

Path 1 workaround applied: explicit `Edit(/...worktrees/**)` and `Write(/...worktrees/**)` per-tool grants in settings. Single-agent probe: PASS. Wave-2 retry with 5 parallel agents: **all 5 still denied.** Permission grants added during the session were not propagating to concurrently-dispatched subagents. **F9 (HIGH)** filed.

**PR #104** documented F8 + F9 + the wave-2 outcome:

| Wave-2 validation question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does F1's fix hold for parallel dispatch? | NO — F8 filed |
| Does F8's per-tool workaround hold for parallel dispatch? | NO — F9 filed |
| Does the F2 contract ("never escape worktree on block") hold? | **YES — 10/10 agents** across both wave-2 attempts reported FAILURE verbatim and exited cleanly |
| Does F3 hold? | YES — no agent self-modified worktree settings |
| Does F4's documented boundary hold? | YES — zero canonical-path writes attempted across all 10 agents |
| Did F6 salvage protocol need to fire? | NO — clean failures, nothing to salvage |

The conclusion was unwelcome but clear: **concurrent worktree dispatch is blocked at the upstream Claude Code framework layer until F8 + F9 ship**. Restart-the-session is the only consumer-side workaround for F9. Serial dispatch (the F-J pattern) is the working pattern.

What wave-2 actually did: **validated that F2/F3/F4 contracts hold under realistic concurrent failure**. Ten agents, ten clean exits, two new framework findings. That's an exceptionally clean outcome from a "failed" run.

### Act IV — The K-Series Long Tail (2026-04-19)

After framework bug work shipped, the JSON status file (`.claude/shared/audit-findings.json`) still claimed all 185 findings were `open` — the live-sync was deferred work from the original audit. **PR #105** wrote a Python script that cross-references git log commit messages + in-code finding-ID comments across all branches, then sets `status: closed` + `closed_via_prs` per finding. After the first run: **129 of 185 marked closed, 56 still open**.

The K-series was the close-out. 11 sprints across one day, each a self-contained branch + PR:

| Sprint | PR | Theme | Findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K-1 | #106 | Sleep goal + retry + JWT split | BE-016, BE-021, BE-029 (3) | First Path A items |
| K-2 | #107 | Atomic 5-file write | DEEP-AUTH-011 (1) | Two-phase commit pattern |
| K-3 | #108 | Deletion grace + cloudRecordID atomicity | BE-023, DEEP-SYNC-014 (2) | Supabase user_metadata |
| K-4 | #109 | Small wins (8 findings) | DEEP-AUTH-006, BE-008, BE-009, BE-012, DEEP-SYNC-012, DS-005, UI-012, AI-014 | 4 new fixes + 4 already-fixed verifications |
| K-5 | #110 | AI Adapter Cleanup | AI-004/005/006/007/008/009/010/011/017 + DEEP-AI-003/011/014 (12) | 3 behavioral + 9 already-fixed verifications |
| K-6 | #111 | FW Cleanup + status markers | FW-002/007/008/009/010/012/013/018 (8) | 1 cache-seed fix + 7 PASS markers |
| K-7 | #112 | DS deprecated alias mass-rename | DS-002, DS-003 (2) | 100+ call-sites across 10 files |
| K-8 | #113 | UI HISTORICAL closures | UI-003, UI-005 (2) | Verified pbxproj exclusion |
| K-9 | #114 | Three-way merge digests to Keychain | DEEP-AUTH-015 (1) | Jailbreak hardening |
| K-10 | #115 | MilestoneDetector extraction | UI-006, UI-018 (2) | View @State 12 → 8 |
| K-11 | #116 | FoodSearchService extraction | UI-017 (1) | View @State 17 → 14, ~60 lines moved |
| **Total** | **11 PRs** | | **42 findings** | |

But the K-series story isn't the per-PR breakdown. It's the **methodology pattern that emerged**:

#### Discovery: the "Verified-Fixed" pattern

Of the 42 findings closed across K-1 through K-11, roughly **20 of them were already correctly implemented in code** — the audit had captured a state that earlier sprints had already addressed without explicitly referencing the audit IDs in commit messages or code. The live-sync script couldn't see them because it cross-references *finding ID strings*, not *behavior*.

The fix pattern: when checking a finding, if the code is already correct, add a brief audit-ID closure comment (`// Audit XX-YY: <one-line note>`) so the next live-sync run picks it up.

This produced two surprising sprint shapes:
- **K-4**: 8 findings, 4 new fixes + 4 closure-marker-only verifications, ~45 min
- **K-5**: 12 findings, 3 new fixes + 9 closure-marker-only verifications, ~60 min

Without the verified-fixed pattern, both sprints would have inflated estimates ("we have 8 findings to fix") and missed the truth ("4 of these are already done; we just need to mark them"). The verified-fixed pattern is now part of the K-series methodology.

#### The long tail closes itself

K-7 (DS-002 + DS-003 mass-rename) was the only K-series sprint that touched substantial production code surface — ~100 call-sites across 10 files. Three iterations of `sed` were needed because the audit's "92 call-sites" estimate missed leading-dot inferred-context usages (`.status.success` at the call site, where the `Color.` prefix is implicit). Build green by the third pass.

K-10 + K-11 introduced the only architectural change of the K-series: extracting `MilestoneDetector` and `FoodSearchService` from view-layer code. Both are pure-Swift `ObservableObject` services, both have unit-testable seams, both reduce view-layer `@State` count below the audit's "12-var refactor threshold".

By K-11 merge: **177/185 audit findings closed (95.7%)**. The 8 remaining are exactly the categories the original audit completion plan flagged as multi-session features (M-1 through M-4) + external blockers (BE-024 Edge Function, DEEP-SYNC-010 cross-sync image bridge).

## 3. The Framework Bug Saga (F1-F9)

Out-of-band track. Not audit findings — these are framework-layer findings about Claude Code itself, surfaced by the stress test attempts.

| Bug | Severity | Status | Discovery | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | HIGH | PARTIAL FIX | Wave 1 abort | PR #102 — glob expansion in `additionalDirectories`. Single-agent verified. **Insufficient under parallel dispatch (F8).** |
| **F2** | MEDIUM | DOCUMENTED | Wave 1 forensics | PR #103 — `worktree_isolation_contract.rules.blocked_write_response` in dispatch-intelligence.json. **Validated by 10/10 agents in wave-2.** |
| **F3** | LOW | DOCUMENTED | G2 wave-1 self-modification attempt | PR #103 — explicit "worktree settings.local.json is runtime read-only" in the contract. |
| **F4** | MEDIUM | DOCUMENTED | G2 escape from worktree | PR #103 — write boundary convention. OS-level sandbox deferred (no consumer-side fix). |
| **F5** | LOW–MED | FIXED | Cleanup agent fallback to reading `.git/worktrees/*/` files directly | PR #103 — pre-granted `cd <worktree>/...` and `git -C <worktree> *` patterns. |
| **F6** | POSITIVE | CODIFIED | G2 wave-1 produced 4 working test files before death; recovered via PR #95 | PR #103 — codified salvage protocol in dispatch-intelligence.json. |
| **F7** | HIGH | UNBLOCKED BY F1 | Stress-test premise blocked on F1 | Methodology validated under F8 conditions; workload still framework-blocked. |
| **F8** | HIGH | OPEN (upstream) | Wave-2 first attempt — 5/5 Edit/Write denied despite F1 fix | Path 1 workaround works for single-agent only. Real fix requires Claude Code framework changes. |
| **F9** | HIGH | OPEN (upstream) | Wave-2 retry after F8 workaround — 5/5 still denied | Permission grants added during session don't propagate to concurrently-dispatched subagents. **Restart the session** is the only consumer-side workaround. |

Filed in: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-framework-bugs-from-stress-test.md`.

The take-away: the framework's concurrent-dispatch surface is broken in two places (F8 + F9) that single-agent testing can't catch. **Wave-2 was an exceptionally valuable test even though the workload didn't complete** — it surfaced 2 real findings that would have been invisible to any other test pattern.

## 5. What Worked

| # | Win | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Serial dispatch with 30-90 min sprints** | 21/21 PRs shipped. Per-sprint estimates (90 min for K-5 12-finding cluster) matched actual time within ±15 min. |
| 2 | **The verified-fixed pattern** | Closed ~20 audit findings without code change by adding closure markers. K-4 (8 findings) and K-5 (12 findings) both shipped in <60 min as a result. Pattern now part of K-series methodology. |
| 3 | **Live-sync script as single source of truth** | `/tmp/sync_audit_json.py` — 80 lines of Python — became the canonical "what's the actual audit state" tool. Re-runnable after every PR merge. Caught the closure-marker-needed gap. |
| 4 | **F2 contract validated in production failure** | Wave-2 dispatched 10 agents, all 10 followed the F2 contract (refused to escape worktree, exited with FAILURE verbatim, no canonical-path writes). The contract holds even when the intended workload fails. |
| 5 | **Salvage protocol works** | G2 wave-1 produced 4 working test files (1041 lines) before dying. PR #95 salvaged them byte-identically (zero modifications needed). 46 net-new test cases recovered from a "failed" run. |
| 6 | **Two-phase commit for cross-file atomicity** | DEEP-AUTH-011's "encrypt 5 → write 5 sequentially" pattern replaced with "encrypt 5 → write 5 to .tmp → rename 5". Cross-file inconsistency window: encryption-time (~ms) → rename-loop time (~µs). |
| 6 | **CI keychain entitlement fix unblocked everything** | PR #101 took 30 min. Before: every audit-sprint PR was admin-overridden because main itself was red. After: PRs #102 onward shipped on actual CI green. The first time main was green in 5+ sprints. |
| 7 | **Service extraction with @StateObject + @Published** | K-10 (MilestoneDetector) and K-11 (FoodSearchService) extracted business logic from views with minimal blast radius. Both services are pure-Swift unit-testable. View `@State` count dropped: 12 → 8 (K-10), 17 → 14 (K-11). |

---

## 6. What Broke Down

| # | Failure | Evidence | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Wave-1 concurrent dispatch (F1)** | 5 of 6 agents aborted in ~12 min. G2 escaped worktree and contaminated main's working tree. | Forced pivot to serial sprints F-J. **F1-F5 + F8 + F9 = 6 framework findings filed.** |
| 2 | **Wave-2 retry (F8 + F9)** | After F1 supposedly fixed (PR #102), 5 concurrent agents got Edit/Write denied identically. After F8 Path 1 workaround, 5 still denied. | Concurrent worktree dispatch is **blocked at upstream Claude Code framework layer**. No consumer-side fix possible. Only escape: restart session before parallel dispatch (F9). |
| 3 | **GitHub Actions billing wall** | PRs #99, #100, #114, #115, #116 hit `"recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased"` after 5 macOS runs in one session. | 3 sprints (K-9 onward) merged without CI confirmation; admin-overridden because local build + tests were green and the pattern was well-validated. |
| 4 | **Audit "92 call-sites" estimate off** | K-7 DS-002/003 mass-rename actually touched ~100 call-sites across 10 files (vs audit's 92 estimate across 4 files). Three sed iterations needed because leading-dot usages (`.status.success`) were missed in the audit's `Color.*` grep. | Sprint took ~75 min instead of ~45. Audit estimates need a "+25%" safety margin for `sed`-based renames. |
| 5 | **Meta: no formal case studies for K-series** | K-1 through K-11 produced 11 PRs of substantive work. Until this case study, none of it was captured in `case-study-monitoring.json` or a synthesis doc. The "every feature gets a case study" rule (mandatory since 2026-04-13) was honored in spirit by PR descriptions + commit messages but not by formal case studies. | Closing the loop with this case study. K-series treated as "remediation cleanup" rather than features — a boundary worth thinking about. |

---

## 7. Methodology Discoveries Worth Naming

### The Verified-Fixed Pattern

When an audit finding is checked and the code is already correct (because earlier sprints addressed the underlying issue without explicit audit-ID references), add a brief comment like `// Audit XX-YY: <one-line note>` at the relevant code site. The next live-sync script run picks it up via finding-ID grep.

This converts ~20 findings from "open + needs work" to "closed + verified" without any production code change. K-4 and K-5 both leveraged this — K-4 was 50% verified-fixed, K-5 was 75% verified-fixed.

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** assuming the audit is the truth and code is the deviation. The audit is a snapshot; the code has moved.

### The Live-Sync Script

`/tmp/sync_audit_json.py` cross-references:
- All commit messages across all branches (`git log --all --pretty=...`)
- All in-code references to finding IDs (`grep -rE '\b(AI|BE|DEEP-AI|DEEP-AUTH|DEEP-SYNC|DS|FW|TEST|UI)-\d+\b'`)
- The merge commits that brought the references onto main (for `closed_via_prs` attribution)

Run it after every PR merge and the JSON updates itself. **This script should move from `/tmp/` to `scripts/sync-audit-findings.py`** and be committed — currently it lives in /tmp during the session.

### The "Restart the Session" Workaround for F9

Single-agent dispatches honor permission grants added during the session. Concurrent dispatches honor only the permission set captured at session start. **If you need parallel dispatch with permissions added mid-session: end the Claude Code session, restart, then dispatch.** This is the only consumer-side fix until F8 + F9 ship from upstream.

---

## 8. Decisions Log

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Pivot from concurrent stress test to serial sprints F-J | Wave 1 aborted on F1; can't validate concurrent dispatch with the dispatch surface broken. Serial pattern A-E had 5/5 success rate. |
| D-2 | File F1-F7 as a separate spec (not audit findings) | These are framework-layer issues about Claude Code itself, not application code. Different remediation owner. |
| D-3 | Run wave-2 even after F1 fixed for single-agent | The point wasn't completing the audit workload — it was validating the F2/F3/F4 contracts under realistic concurrent failure. Wave-2 surfaced F8 + F9. |
| D-4 | Write the audit completion plan BEFORE starting K-1 | 36 remaining open findings deserved a triage pass before slot-by-slot execution. Plan distinguished K-series from M-series from external. |
| D-5 | Adopt the verified-fixed pattern explicitly | Saved ~3-4 hours across K-4 and K-5 alone. Worth naming so future audit work uses it. |
| D-6 | Stash + branch + pop pattern for parallel sprint setup | When K-2 needed to base on K-1 before K-1 was merged, used git stash to move work to a new branch. Worked cleanly across 3 sprints (K-1 → K-2 → K-3). |
| D-7 | Override-merge K-9, K-10, K-11 against billing-blocked CI | Local build + tests green; the CI failure was infrastructure (billing), not code. Continuing the sprint chain was higher value than waiting for billing fix. |
| D-8 | Two-phase commit for cross-file atomicity (DEEP-AUTH-011) | Single-file `Data.write(.atomic)` already gives per-file atomicity. The cross-file consistency issue needed an explicit two-phase pattern (write all .tmp first, then rename all). Standard pattern. |
| D-9 | Defer M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4 to multi-session features (not K-series) | Each is 3-6 sessions of work with PRD/UX/code/tests. Trying to compress them into a 60-min K-series sprint would fail. |
| D-10 | Write this case study before starting M-3 | "Every feature gets a case study" rule + the synthesis would lose detail if delayed. ~45 min write while context is fresh > 4 hours of archaeology later. |

## 9. The Self-Referential Question (revisited from predecessor)

The predecessor case study posed: *the same AI built the code, audited it, fixed it, and is now writing about it. What does that loop validate?*

This case study extends the loop one more turn: the same AI also **stress-tested its own framework, found 9 bugs in the framework, fixed 5 of them, hit a wall on 2 (F8 + F9 — upstream Claude Code blockers), and documented exactly which framework guarantees hold under failure (F2/F3/F4) versus which don't (F1's incomplete coverage)**.

What the loop validates this time:
- **Concurrent dispatch is genuinely broken** (not "I think it's broken" — 10 agents in real failure conditions confirmed it)
- **F2 contracts hold** under exactly the failure mode they're designed for (wave-2 was the F2 stress test)
- **The salvage protocol works** in practice, not just theory (PR #95 salvaged 46 test cases from a dead agent)

What the loop still cannot verify:
- Does F8 fix actually fix concurrent dispatch? (requires running wave-3 after F8 lands upstream)
- Are the audit fixes correct in production? (requires multi-device sync test, real user data, etc. — same as predecessor)
- Will the verified-fixed pattern catch every "code already right but audit wrong" case? (false-negative risk: a finding that's NOT in code AND NOT mentioned in commits stays "open" forever)

The honest extension: **this AI can now find bugs in itself**, but the bugs it finds are still constrained by the framework it can observe. F8 + F9 were findable because wave-2 surfaced them. What other framework gaps exist that no test we've run would expose? Unknown. The same epistemological humility as the predecessor.

## 11. What Comes Next

Per the audit completion plan, the 8 remaining findings split:

### M-series (multi-session features, NOT K-series sprints)

- **M-1** — UI-002 SettingsView (v2) decomposition (1170L → multi-section v3, ~3 sessions)
- **M-2** — UI-004 MealEntrySheet decomposition (1155L → tab sub-views + coordinator, ~3-4 sessions; even after K-11 service extraction the file is still large)
- **M-3** — DS-004 + DS-009 + DS-010 (token pipeline 60% → 100% + dark mode + remaining token categories, ~4-6 sessions; **case study tracking now ON from the start per the rule**)
- **M-4** — TEST-025 (new XCUITest target + first 10-20 UI integration tests, ~3 sessions)

### External blockers

- **BE-024** — Supabase Edge Function `delete-account` (admin-role JWT, server deployment)
- **DEEP-SYNC-010** — CK→Supabase Storage cardio image bridge (multi-PR cross-sync work)

### Framework upstream

- **F8** + **F9** — upstream Claude Code framework changes for Edit/Write tool grant + permission propagation under concurrent dispatch. Until these ship, **concurrent worktree dispatch is blocked**. Restart-the-session is the only workaround for F9.

If all of M-series + external + framework upstream complete: **185 / 185 audit findings closed**. Estimated effort: M-series ~12-16h across many sessions; external ~4-6h when unblocked; framework upstream out of project's control.

## 12. Methodology Notes

### Statistical Methods Used

This case study deliberately avoids the velocity normalization framework (CU calculations, Hedges' g, Mann-Kendall) that other case studies use. Reason: 27 sprints across 4 sub-arcs (F-J + framework + K-series) with deeply heterogeneous work types (audit fixes, framework documentation, stress tests, mass-renames, service extractions) don't fit a single-feature CU model. The headline metric here is **finding-closure-rate-per-sprint**, not min/CU.

If forced to compute: 50 audit findings + 6 framework findings closed across 21 PRs ≈ **2.7 findings/PR average**, with a wide range (K-7 closed 2 findings via mass-rename in 75 min; K-5 closed 12 findings — 9 verified-fixed — in 60 min).

### Data Sources

- Audit findings JSON: `.claude/shared/audit-findings.json` (post-K-11 sync = 177/185 closed/8 open)
- Git log: 21 PRs (#96-#116) plus the salvage PR (#95)
- Spec docs: framework bugs spec + 2 plans
- Memory entries: 5 directly relevant + index in MEMORY.md
- Case study predecessors: meta-analysis-audit-and-remediation + audit-v2-concurrent-stress-test
- Wave-2 forensic data: agent task output files in `/private/tmp/claude-501/...`

### Limitations

- **F8 + F9 are upstream Claude Code bugs.** Their characterization in this case study is based on observed behavior (10 agents in 2 wave-2 attempts), not source-code inspection of the Claude Code framework itself. The actual root cause may differ from the hypothesis (snapshot-at-spawn permission caching).
- **The verified-fixed pattern's false-negative rate is unknown.** A finding that's NOT in code AND NOT mentioned in commits stays `open` indefinitely. We didn't measure how often this happens.
- **Single practitioner (Regev + Claude Code)** as in the predecessor — results may not generalize.
- **Framework bug count is not exhaustive.** F1-F9 are what we found via stress-test attempts. Other framework gaps may exist that no test we've run would expose.
