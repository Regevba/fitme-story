# Case Study Template — PM Framework Performance Analysis

> **Purpose:** Every feature executed through the PM workflow produces a case study. This template ensures consistent structure, metrics, and analysis so framework performance can be compared across versions.
>
> **Core question:** How did the framework version affect development speed and quality?
>
> **Usage:** Copy this template to `docs/case-studies/{feature}-v{version}-case-study.md` and fill in each section. Data sources: `state.json`, `case-study-monitoring.json`, `git log`, session timing.
>
> **Data quality tiers:** Every quantitative metric below must be tagged
> **T1** (Instrumented), **T2** (Declared), or **T3** (Narrative). The
> existing `(m/e/i)` markers on phase-timing and cache-detail rows are a
> valid shorthand — `(m)` = T1, `(e)` / `(i)` = T3 (or T2 if derived from
> a structured declaration). See
> [`data-quality-tiers.md`](./data-quality-tiers.md) for the full
> convention. Reader trust in a metric is directly indexed on its tier;
> a T3 number quoted as if it were T1 is a bug, not a stylistic choice.

## 2. Experiment Design

### Independent Variable
- **Framework version** at time of execution (e.g., v4.4)

### Dependent Variables
| DV | Unit | How Measured |
|----|------|-------------|
| Wall time | hours | timing.total_wall_time_minutes from state.json ({measured/estimated}) |
| Planning velocity | phases/hour | Phases 0-3 time ÷ phase count |
| Implementation velocity | files/hour | Files created+modified ÷ Phase 4 time |
| Task completion rate | tasks/hour | Tasks completed ÷ total time |
| Cache hit rate | % | Cache sources cited ÷ total research actions |
| Eval pass rate | % | Evals passing ÷ total evals defined |
| Defect escape rate | count | Bugs found post-implementation (code review) |
| Test density | tests/event | Analytics tests ÷ analytics events |
| Serial improvement | multiplier | baseline_min_CU / this_feature_min_CU |
| Parallel speedup | multiplier | parallel_CU_per_hour / serial_CU_per_hour |

### Complexity Proxy
- Files created + modified (scope indicator)
- Work type (feature > enhancement > fix > chore)
- Has UI (yes/no — UI features are more complex)

### Controls
- Same PM workflow (same 10-phase lifecycle)
- Same developer (Regev + Claude Code)
- Same codebase (FitMe iOS app)
- Same design system (AppTheme tokens)

### Confounders (documented, not controlled)
- Feature complexity varies (documented via files/tasks count)
- Framework evolves between features (this IS the signal)
- Practitioner learning (partially captured by cache hit rate)
- Session continuity (single session vs. multi-session)

## 8. Methodology Notes

### Statistical Methods Used
- **Design:** Within-subjects repeated measures (each feature = one measurement of the same framework)
- **Effect size:** Hedges' g with small-sample correction (N < 20)
- **Trend detection:** Mann-Kendall test for monotonic improvement
- **Curve fitting:** Power law regression T = a * N^(-b) where b = improvement rate
- **Confidence intervals:** Bootstrap (BCa) with 10,000 resamples (when N > 6)

### Data Sources
- `state.json` — phase timestamps, task completion, metrics
- `case-study-monitoring.json` — process metrics, quality metrics, ai_quality_metrics
- `git log` — commit counts, file changes, PR data
- Session observations — wall time, decisions, blockers

### Limitations
- Single practitioner (Regev + Claude Code) — results may not generalize
- Framework evolves between measurements — cannot isolate framework effect from learning
- Feature complexity varies — normalized but not perfectly controlled
- Small sample size — effect sizes are estimates, not definitive
