```

### Domain Agents (Parallel Dispatch)

Six agents ran concurrently in Layer 1, each constrained to its domain. This prevented cross-domain bias from influencing the initial surface pass. Results were merged into `audit-findings.json` before Layer 2 targeting was decided.

### Risk-Weighted Deep Dive Targeting

Layer 2 targets were selected by two criteria: (1) Layer 1 findings density per file, and (2) CLAUDE.md high-risk file list. `SignInService.swift` (965 lines, 9 high/critical surface findings), `EncryptionService.swift` (741 lines), `SupabaseSyncService.swift`, and `CloudKitSyncService.swift` were all targeted. Layer 2 yielded 28 additional root-cause findings that explained 31 Layer 1 findings.

### Cross-Reference Against 18 Case Studies

Layer 3 sampled 5 key case studies (v5.1–v5.2 evolution, AI engine architecture, onboarding auth flow, SoC v5, framework measurement v6) to classify findings as:
- **Recurring** — same pattern seen before (9 matches)
- **Regression** — previously "fixed" issue re-emerged (2 matches)
- **Predicted** — prior case study explicitly called out the gap (4 matches)
- **New Category** — never seen before (5 new categories)

### External Validation Protocol

21 findings were confirmed by objective, non-AI signals: `xcodebuild` build success, `xcodebuild test` (231 assertions), large-file line counts via `wc -l`, and token budget from the tiktoken-equivalent script. These findings carry the highest credibility because the validation is independent of the AI that wrote them.

### Self-Referential Bias Acknowledgment

This audit was performed by the same AI system that built the framework being audited. The implications of this are documented in full in Section 10.

## 3. Experiment Design

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| Independent Variable | Audit methodology: framework-driven self-referential 4-layer sweep vs. manual code review |
| DV 1 — Findings Count | 185 total identified |
| DV 2 — Severity Distribution | 12 critical / 49 high / 90 medium / 25 low / 9 info |
| DV 3 — External Validation Rate | 21/185 = 11.4% |
| DV 4 — Cross-Reference Hit Rate | 18/185 = 9.7% (recurring + regression + predicted) |
| DV 5 — Time Efficiency | Structured; not clock-measured (session_end not recorded) |
| Baseline | BUILD SUCCEEDED, 231 tests passing, 0 failures (validated 2026-04-16) |
| Control | Prior art: 18 individual case studies, each covering a single feature |

The methodology is first-of-kind (no prior whole-system audit to compare against). The experiment establishes a baseline for future audits rather than testing against an existing one.

## 4. Layer 1 Results — Surface Sweep

| Domain | Findings | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backend | 60 | 2 (surface) | 18 | 22 | 13 | 5 |
| Tests | 30 | 5 | 8 | 15 | 2 | 0 |
| AI | 20 | 0 | 1 | 9 | 8 | 2 |
| UI | 25 | 0 | 5 | 9 | 7 | 4 |
| Design System | 15 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 3 | 0 |
| Framework | 20 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 4 | 3 |
| **Totals (L1)** | **170** | **7** | **37** | **75** | **37** | **14** |

Layer 2 added 15 findings, bringing totals to 185.

### Layer 1 Highlights by Domain

**Backend**: `SignInService.swift` was the most defect-dense file with 9 high/critical surface findings including debug tokens persisted to Keychain (BE-001/BE-002), unsigned passkey assertions used as session tokens (BE-006), and `signOut()` swallowing errors silently while using `.local` scope (BE-003). `SupabaseSyncService.swift` had 12 findings around error swallowing, auth expiry silence, and realtime concurrency.

**Tests**: 5 critical-severity findings for zero-coverage of all 5 CLAUDE.md high-risk files: `EncryptionService`, `AuthManager`, `CloudKitSyncService`, `SupabaseSyncService`, `HealthKitService`. 9 tests were also found to assert against local arithmetic constants rather than the production code they claim to test (TEST-018 through TEST-022).

**AI**: A systemic fabrication pattern in the adapter layer — 3 `ProfileAdapter` fields hardcoded rather than reading user preferences (AI-004/AI-005/AI-006), and `HealthKitAdapter.stressLevel()` returning `"moderate"` fabricated when no log exists (AI-007). This pattern was the root cause identified in the DEEP-AI-015 deep dive.

**UI**: 4 HISTORICAL v1 files still present in the repo (TrainingPlanView 2141 lines, NutritionView 1112 lines, SettingsView v1 1189 lines, SettingsView v2 1170 lines). `MealEntrySheet.swift` (1155 lines, 17 `@State` vars, 4 tabs) is the most complex actively-compiled view.

**Design System**: 66 deprecated `Color.status.*`/`Color.accent.*` calls still active (DS-002) despite a token migration previously claimed complete. Dark mode support absent — all Surface tokens are white-based with no dark variants (DS-009). Token pipeline covers only ~60% of `AppTheme.swift` — chart, motion, opacity, size, and layout tokens absent from `tokens.json` (DS-004).

**Framework**: All `_index.json` cache files have empty `entries[]` arrays — cache discovery is non-functional (FW-011). `cache-metrics.json` has all-zero values despite 8+ completed features (FW-005). `framework-health.json` has never had a Phase 0 health check run (FW-014).

---

## 5. Layer 2 Results — Deep Dive

Layer 2 applied root-cause analysis to the two highest-risk clusters identified in Layer 1: the authentication/encryption complex (`SignInService.swift`, `AuthManager.swift`, `EncryptionService.swift`) and the dual-sync architecture (`SupabaseSyncService.swift`, `CloudKitSyncService.swift`).

### Discovery 1 — DEEP-AI-015: Fabrication-Over-Nil Systemic Pattern

Root cause of 12 AI-domain findings. The pattern: adapter methods use non-optional return types, so when source data is absent, the code fabricates a plausible-sounding value rather than returning nil and triggering the `insufficientData` path.

Instances: `genderIdentity` hardcoded to `"prefer_not_to_say"` (AI-004), `trainingDaysPerWeek` returning enum case count not user schedule (AI-005), `dietPattern` hardcoded to `"standard"` (AI-006), `stressLevel()` returning `"moderate"` when no log exists (AI-007), `BMI` using stale `startWeightKg` fallback (AI-008), `mealsPerDay` counting planned-but-uneaten meals (AI-010), local fallback using `"Fat Loss"` string while `ProfileAdapter` stores `"weight_loss"` (AI-014).

**Impact**: Every user with a completed profile receives AI recommendations that ignore their actual gender, diet, training frequency, and stress data. The cloud AI tier processes fabricated bands. The three-tier architecture's `insufficientData` fallback path is structurally bypassed.

**Fix**: Make adapter return types `Optional<T>`. Return nil when source is absent. Let orchestrator propagate nil signals to the `insufficientData` path.

### Discovery 2 — DEEP-SYNC-001: Dual-Sync Race Condition

CloudKit and Supabase both pull on login with no merge coordination. Both call `persistToDisk()` independently. The last one to finish overwrites the other's result non-deterministically. There is no conflict resolver between the two sync paths.

Additionally: DEEP-SYNC-002 shows `lastPull` advancing even when rows fail decryption, permanently skipping failed rows. DEEP-SYNC-005 shows AES-GCM random IV makes singleton checksum comparisons always fail — the skip-if-unchanged optimization is dead code. DEEP-SYNC-003 shows CloudKit daily log merge ignores `needsSync` (unlike weekly snapshot merge), overwriting unsaved local edits.

**Impact**: Data integrity on multi-device usage is uncertain. Users editing on one device while the other device syncs can silently lose changes.

### Discovery 3 — DEEP-AUTH-001/002: Review-Mode and Passkey Security Gaps

DEEP-AUTH-001: `applyReviewSessionIfNeeded()` has no `#if DEBUG` fence. Any production binary that receives `FITTRACKER_REVIEW_AUTH=authenticated` authenticates as developer identity `'Regev'` with token `'review-session-token'`. The environment variable name is visible in the binary string table.

DEEP-AUTH-002: The passkey assertion (`cred.signature.base64EncodedString()`) is used directly as the session token without server-side WebAuthn verification. `backendAccessToken` is nil for all passkey sessions. Passkey is local-only with no backend trust anchor.

DEEP-AUTH-005: The session restore timeout fix from the auth flow case study (detached task + 5s timeout) introduced a regression. The nil branch doesn't call `timeout.cancel()`, creating a double-resume crash risk.

DEEP-AUTH-004: `UserSession.sessionToken` holds 5 different types of values (UUID, passkey signature, Supabase JWT, debug literal, Apple userID) with no type contract.

## 6. Layer 3 Results — Cross-Reference

### Recurring Patterns (9 matches)

| Finding | Prior Case Study | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| BE-001/BE-002 | v5.1–v5.2 evolution | Permission/sandbox boundaries causing silent failures |
| AI-004/AI-005/AI-006 | AI engine architecture | Hardcoded fallback values suppressing real data |
| AI-007/AI-008 | AI engine architecture | Non-optional return types fabricating data |
| DS-001 | Onboarding v2 auth flow | Token bypass in compiled v2 files |
| FW-005 | Framework measurement v6 | Measurement infrastructure defined but never populated |

| TEST-001 through TEST-005 | AI engine architecture | High-risk services with zero test coverage |
| BE-005/DEEP-AUTH-005 | Onboarding v2 auth flow | Session restore race conditions |

### Regressions (2)

- **DEEP-AUTH-005**: The session restore freeze fix introduced in the auth flow case study (detached task + 5s timeout) regressed — nil branch doesn't cancel timeout, creating double-resume crash risk.
- **DS-002**: Token migration claimed complete in the SoC case study. 66 deprecated `Color.status.*`/`Color.accent.*` calls remain active.

### Predicted Findings (4)

| Finding | Predicted By |
|---|---|
| FW-005/FW-014 (measurement infra all zeros) | SoC case study section 7 called for token budget dashboard |
| TEST-025 (zero XCUITests) | Auth flow case study identified UI integration test gap |
| FW-019 (80% vs 75% prediction accuracy) | v5.2 case study acknowledged small sample size |
| UI-017/UI-006 (state debt) | Auth flow case study recommended design-review gate |

### New Categories (5)

| Category | Finding IDs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication token type safety | DEEP-AUTH-001 through DEEP-AUTH-004 | `sessionToken` holds 5 untyped value classes |
| Cryptographic checksum invalidation | DEEP-SYNC-005 | AES-GCM random IV causes checksums to always fail |
| Schema versioning for encrypted blobs | DEEP-SYNC-013 | `DailyLog` lacks `schemaVersion` — migration impossible |
| Dark mode token absence | DS-009 | All Surface tokens light-mode only, no dark variants |
| Biometric enrollment data loss | BE-015 | `.biometryCurrentSet` invalidates all encrypted data on re-enrollment |

### UX Compliance Matrix (13 Principles × 6 Screens)

**Red violations**: Principle 1.6 (Consistency) in Training and Nutrition. Training: 35 deprecated color calls, 10 ad-hoc animation literals. Nutrition: 11 deprecated color calls, 2 inline `GeometryReader` progress bars bypassing the `ProgressBar` component.

**Suspicious all-green principles** (6): 1.3 Jakob's Law, 1.5 Recognition Over Recall, 1.7 Feedback, 1.9 Readiness-First, 1.12 Progressive Profiling, 1.13 Celebration Not Guilt. These are flagged as possibly under-detected rather than genuinely perfect — see Section 10.

### Framework Self-Audit

The framework audit surfaced 8 findings (FW-META-001 through FW-META-008):

- **Token budget grew 25%** (79K → 99K) between v6.0 and this audit, entirely from shared layer growth (19K → 37K). The audit is inflating the metric it claims to measure.
- **`cache-metrics.json` all zeros** despite 8+ completed features with documented cache hits in case study narratives. All cache performance claims in published case studies are narrative, not measured.
- **Phase 0 health check has never fired.** `framework-health.json` has `history: [], last_check: null`.
- **Dispatch prediction accuracy discrepancy**: case study reports 80%, raw log records 75%. Small sample (5 dispatches) makes either number unreliable.
- **Cache discovery non-functional**: all `_index.json` files have `entries: []`. Cache hits rely on skills hardcoding specific file names, not task-signature lookup. The SoC v5 "cache compression" feature compresses entries that are then undiscoverable.
- **Version inconsistency**: `audit-findings.json` says 6.1, other configs say 6.0, `framework-manifest.json` description says v5.2.
- **3 stale monitoring entries**: 2 stuck at framework_version 4.3 (4 major versions behind), 1 at 4.4.
- **Token estimation error ~15%**: word-count × 1.3 method, tiktoken not installed.

## 7. Layer 4 Results — External Validation

### Validation Distribution

| Validation Type | Count | Pct | What It Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| External-Automated | 21 | 11.4% | Confirmed by build, test, `wc -l`, or token script — independent of AI |
| Cross-Referenced | 18 | 9.7% | Confirmed against prior case study findings or prior documented decisions |
| Framework-Only | 146 | 78.9% | AI assertion from code reading — plausible but unverified |

### External-Automated Findings

The 21 findings confirmed externally are primarily:
- TEST-001 through TEST-005: confirmed by `grep` across test files returning zero results for the 5 high-risk services
- TEST-008: confirmed by grep across all test files for adapter names
- UI-001, UI-002, UI-003, UI-004, UI-005: confirmed by `wc -l` measurements (2141, 1170, 1112, 1155, 1189 lines)
- DEEP-SYNC-005: confirmed by architectural analysis — AES-GCM random IV is a mathematical property, not a code reading inference
- FW-001: confirmed by reading multiple config files and comparing version fields
- FW-005/FW-011: confirmed by reading `cache-metrics.json` (all zeros) and all `_index.json` files (all empty arrays)

### Build and Test Baseline (Layer 4 anchor)

`xcodebuild build` and `xcodebuild test` both ran successfully as pre-audit baseline. 231 tests pass, 0 fail. This means: (a) the 185 findings do not include any regression to the build or test suite, and (b) the 5 critical test-coverage findings represent services with no tests at all — not failing tests.

---

## 8. Top 10 Findings

| Rank | ID | Sev | Domain | What / Why / Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DEEP-AUTH-001 | Critical | Backend | Review-mode session has no `#if DEBUG` fence. Production binary receiving `FITTRACKER_REVIEW_AUTH=authenticated` authenticates as developer. Env var name visible in binary. **Fix**: Wrap `applyReviewSessionIfNeeded()` in `#if DEBUG`. Trivial effort. |
| 2 | DEEP-AUTH-002 | Critical | Backend | Passkey WebAuthn assertion used as session token without server verification. All passkey sessions have no backend trust anchor. `backendAccessToken` is nil. **Fix**: POST assertion to Supabase Edge Function for server verification before `finishSignIn()`. Large effort but security-critical. |
| 3 | DEEP-SYNC-001 | Critical | Backend | CloudKit + Supabase both pull on login with no merge coordination. Last `persistToDisk()` wins non-deterministically. Data integrity on multi-device uncertain. **Fix**: Sequence syncs or add a merge coordinator. Large effort, high data-loss risk. |
| 4 | DEEP-AUTH-015 (pattern) | Critical | AI | Fabrication-over-nil systemic pattern across 5 adapters. 12 findings rooted here. AI recommendations are processed with fabricated gender, diet, training frequency, and stress data. **Fix**: Return `Optional<T>` from adapters; propagate nil to `insufficientData` path. |
| 5 | TEST-001 through TEST-005 | Critical | Tests | `EncryptionService`, `AuthManager`, `CloudKitSyncService`, `SupabaseSyncService`, `HealthKitService` have zero tests. These are CLAUDE.md-designated high-risk files. **Fix**: Add dedicated test files for each. Medium–high effort per service. |
| 6 | DEEP-AUTH-005 | High | Backend | Session restore timeout regression. The auth flow case study fix (5s timeout) was incomplete. The nil branch doesn't cancel the timeout, creating a double-resume crash in debug, undefined behavior in release. **Fix**: Add `timeout.cancel()` in else branch. Small effort. |
| 7 | DEEP-SYNC-002 | Critical | Backend | `lastPull` advances even when rows fail decryption — failed records permanently skipped on subsequent syncs. User data silently lost. **Fix**: Track failed row timestamps; don't advance `lastPull` past oldest failure. Medium effort. |
| 8 | DEEP-AUTH-004 | High | Backend | `UserSession.sessionToken` holds 5 untyped value classes (UUID, passkey sig, Supabase JWT, debug literal, Apple userID) with no type contract. **Fix**: Restrict `sessionToken` to Supabase-issued tokens only; add enum for token types. Medium effort. |
| 9 | BE-015 | Medium | Backend | `.biometryCurrentSet` invalidates all encrypted health data when user adds a new fingerprint or face. No recovery path. Catastrophic data loss. **Fix**: Use `.biometryAny` or implement a key recovery mechanism. Medium effort. |
| 10 | FW-005 / FW-011 | High | Framework | `cache-metrics.json` all zeros (measurement protocol never fires) + all `_index.json` files empty (cache discovery non-functional). All published cache performance claims are narrative, not measured. **Fix**: Fix measurement trigger in SKILL.md; fix cache indexing on write. Medium effort. |

## 9. System Health Scorecard

| Domain | Score | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| AI | 0 | F |
| Backend | 0 | F |
| Tests | 0 | F |
| UI | 9 | F |
| Framework | 42 | D |
| Design System | 46 | D |
| **Overall** | **16.2** | **F** |

### Score Interpretation

The scorecard weights finding severity: critical and high findings dominate the score negatively. A domain needs zero critical/high findings and few medium findings to score above 50.

**AI (0)**: The fabrication-over-nil pattern means 5 of 7 core adapter methods are structurally broken. Every AI recommendation since launch has been computed using partially or entirely fabricated input bands. The three-tier architecture exists, is correctly structured, and the confidence gating works — but its inputs are compromised.

**Backend (0)**: 2 critical and 18 high findings including authentication bypass risk, data loss on biometric re-enrollment, dual-sync race condition, `lastPull` advancement on decryption failure, and non-atomic key rotation. The encryption infrastructure is architecturally sound but has multiple time-of-check/time-of-use gaps.

**Tests (0)**: 5 critical-severity zero-coverage findings for the exact files CLAUDE.md designates high-risk. 9 tests assert against local arithmetic rather than production code. No XCUITest suite. No snapshot tests. No offline scenario tests. The 231 tests that exist pass, but their scope is insufficient.

**UI (9)**: Score is dragged down by 5 high-severity large-file findings. `MealEntrySheet.swift` (1155 lines, 17 `@State`) is the most complex actively-compiled view and the highest-priority UI refactor target. The 4 HISTORICAL v1 files inflate tooling but do not affect runtime.

**Framework (42)**: HADF passes all integrity checks (17 chip profiles, 7 hardware signatures, correct confidence thresholds). Skill routing is valid (all SKILL.md files exist). The deductions come from broken cache discovery, unmeasured metrics, and version inconsistencies. The framework infrastructure is structurally correct but its measurement layer is non-functional.

**Design System (46)**: Token coverage for core color, text, and spacing tokens is high. Deductions come from the 66 deprecated color calls still active (DS-002), dark mode absent (DS-009), and ~40% of token categories absent from the CI-gated pipeline. The design system is functional at the component level but incomplete at the token-pipeline level.

### What Is Working Well

- BUILD passes cleanly across 143 Swift files and 143,000+ lines of code.
- 231 unit and eval tests run with 0 failures.
- Design system token coverage for the 6 v2-aligned screens is good — the UX compliance matrix shows green across most principles for most screens.
- HADF infrastructure is complete and structurally intact.
- AI three-tier architecture (local → cloud → FoundationModel) is correctly implemented at the orchestration level.
- The v2 refactor methodology produced consistent v2 files for all 6 screens without breaking the build.

## 10. Self-Referential Bias Report

### Validation Distribution at Audit Completion

At the time the 185 findings were written: 100% were framework-only (AI assertion only). After cross-reference and build/test verification: 78.9% remain framework-only, 9.7% are cross-referenced, 11.4% are externally validated.

**The most honest statement**: 146 of 185 findings are assertions from code reading. They are plausible based on static analysis, but without runtime verification, some percentage will be false positives (dead code paths, correct behavior under conditions not visible in source) or missing context (e.g., BE-001/BE-002 may be safe if App Store review's sandboxing prevents `FITTRACKER_REVIEW_AUTH` from ever being set in production).

### What This Audit CAN Detect

- Code patterns that are structurally wrong (non-optional return types where nil is semantically meaningful)
- Security configurations that are definitively incorrect by definition (hardcoded tokens without `#if DEBUG`, raw signature used as session token)
- Coverage gaps (files with zero test references)
- Token compliance (token vs. raw literal usage)
- Configuration consistency across JSON files
- Historical pattern matching against documented case studies

### What This Audit CANNOT Detect

1. **Runtime behavior**: The audit never ran the app. Bugs requiring specific state sequences (sign out during sync, biometric re-enrollment, network timeout during key rotation) are described from code analysis but not verified. The auth flow case study proved this class of bug exists — email registration was broken in a way only runtime testing could find.

2. **Performance**: Zero profiling. No data on cold start time, sync latency, `ReadinessEngine` computation time, or `EncryptedDataStore` load time under real data.

3. **Concurrency**: Thread safety is limited to `async/await` pattern reading. Actor reentrancy, main-thread blocking, and deadlocks require runtime analysis. DEEP-SYNC-007 (actor reentrancy) was identified from code but concurrency bugs are notoriously under-detected by static analysis.

4. **UI/UX Quality**: UX compliance matrix scores are inferred from code structure and design system usage. Actual user experience (gesture responsiveness, animation smoothness, cognitive load, discoverability) requires usability testing. Zero users were observed.

5. **Security exploitability**: DEEP-AUTH-001 and DEEP-AUTH-002 are identified from code, but actual exploitability depends on runtime conditions, network configuration, and App Store review behavior.

6. **Third-party dependencies**: No examination of Supabase SDK CVEs, GoogleSignIn SDK advisories, or CryptoKit version-specific issues.

7. **Data migration**: No analysis of what happens when app updates change model schemas across versions.

8. **Accessibility**: TEST-028 and UI-019/UI-020 were found, but VoiceOver navigation, Dynamic Type at all sizes, and Switch Control compatibility were not systematically verified.

### The 6 Suspicious All-Green UX Principles

1.3 Jakob's Law — All green. Suspicious: audit focused on code-level issues. Jakob's Law violations (non-standard navigation, custom patterns violating iOS HIG) require runtime/visual inspection. Likely missed, not perfect.

1.7 Feedback — All green. Suspicious: code-level scan cannot detect *missing* feedback — only *wrong* feedback. Runtime testing would likely surface haptic and toast gaps.

1.13 Celebration Not Guilt — Plausible but unverified: no guilt-tripping copy was found, but the audit did not exhaustively check all notification text, empty states, and error messages.

### The Core Credibility Problem

This audit was performed by the same AI system that built the framework being audited. Three credibility problems follow:

1. **Blind-spot alignment**: The audit finds issues in categories the AI understands (code patterns, token compliance, test coverage gaps) and misses categories it cannot observe (runtime behavior, real user experience, actual security exploitability). The UX compliance matrix, for example, is scored entirely from code structure — a human UX review would almost certainly find different and more severe issues.

2. **Self-critical performance**: The framework findings (FW-META-001 through FW-META-008) are the most credible section because they are genuinely self-critical — they identify cases where the framework's own claims are unsupported by evidence. But acknowledging limitations does not make those limitations less real.

3. **100% framework-only at authorship**: Every finding was an assertion when written. Cross-reference and external validation were applied post-hoc, leaving 78.9% still as assertions.

**Implication for action**: Treat this audit as a prioritized list of plausible issues, not ground truth. The critical and high findings warrant investigation precisely because they are plausible — not because they are verified. The next mandatory step is external validation for the top 10 findings (runtime testing, security review, or crash/analytics data from real users).

| 5 | Track failed decryption rows; don't advance `lastPull` past failures (DEEP-SYNC-002) | Backend | Medium | Data loss prevention |
| 6 | Add test coverage for EncryptionService, AuthManager, CloudKitSyncService, HealthKitService (TEST-001–005) | Tests | Medium each | Risk coverage |
| 7 | Fix cache `_index.json` population on write; fix `cache-metrics.json` measurement trigger (FW-005/FW-011) | Framework | Medium | Measurement integrity |
| 8 | Remove `biometryCurrentSet` — use `biometryAny` or implement key recovery (BE-015) | Backend | Medium | Data loss prevention |

### Prioritization Rationale

Items 1–2 are trivial/small effort with critical security and crash-prevention impact — they should ship in the next commit. Items 3–5 are the highest-leverage correctness fixes (AI quality, data integrity). Items 6–7 address structural gaps in the test and measurement infrastructure. Items 8–9 address data loss and design system consistency. Item 10 is the largest effort and requires a backend deployment, making it a separate sprint.

## 12. Lessons Learned

### What the Methodology Got Right

**Parallel domain agents prevent cross-domain anchoring.** Running 6 independent agents for Layer 1 before any synthesis meant that Backend findings did not influence what the Tests agent looked for, and UI findings did not bias the Design System agent. The domain boundaries held, and the severity distribution across domains reflects independent assessments.

**Risk-weighted deep diving multiplied value.** The 28 Layer 2 findings explained 31 Layer 1 findings as symptoms of root causes. Without Layer 2, the 31 surface findings would have been treated as 31 independent problems. Layer 2 reduced the actual repair surface significantly — fixing DEEP-AUTH-001 (trivial) eliminates BE-001 and BE-002; fixing the fabrication-over-nil pattern (one architectural decision) fixes AI-004 through AI-008.

**Historical cross-reference caught regressions.** The two regressions (DEEP-AUTH-005, DS-002) would have been invisible without Layer 3. Both appeared to be complete features. The cross-reference identified them as false closures — previously "fixed" issues that had reopened or never fully closed.

**External validation as anchor.** The 21 externally-validated findings are the most actionable because they are definitively true. `wc -l` confirms MealEntrySheet is 1155 lines. The build succeeds. The grep confirms EncryptionService has zero test references. These findings require no further verification.

### What the Methodology Missed

**Runtime behavior is a complete blind spot.** The methodology is entirely static. The most severe security findings (DEEP-AUTH-001, DEEP-AUTH-002) were identified from code reading, but their actual exploitability in production has not been tested. A 30-minute runtime security test would raise the confidence of the top 10 findings from "plausible" to "verified."

**The UX compliance matrix is overconfident.** Scoring 6 principles all-green across all 6 screens from code reading alone is implausible. A half-day of VoiceOver navigation testing would likely find violations that static analysis cannot see.

**Measurement infrastructure was audited, not fixed.** FW-005 and FW-011 (cache-metrics all zeros, cache discovery broken) were identified and documented. But because this is a Chore work item, no fixes were applied. The next framework-touching feature should fix these before claiming cache performance metrics.

**Self-referential audits are structurally limited.** An AI system auditing the framework it designed will find issues in the categories it was designed to think about. A human security reviewer, a real user, or a fuzzer would find different issues. The 185 findings are the floor of the defect surface, not the ceiling.

### How to Improve the Next Audit

1. Add a runtime validation phase (Layer 5): run the app on a simulator, exercise the top 3 critical flows, confirm or deny the critical findings.
2. Introduce a human review gate before publishing critical security findings — specifically for authentication and encryption claims.
3. Fix cache-metrics.json and _index.json before the next audit so the framework's own measurement infrastructure is functional.
4. Add a structured comparison to the prior audit's findings count and distribution to detect trend direction.
5. Schedule the next full-system audit at a framework version milestone (v7.0 or equivalent) rather than ad-hoc, to enable longitudinal health tracking.
