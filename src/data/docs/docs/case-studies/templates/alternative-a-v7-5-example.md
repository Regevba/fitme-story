# Data Integrity Framework — v7.5 Case Study

## 1. Why This Case Study Exists

The v7.1 Integrity Cycle (2026-04-21) shipped self-observation: a 72h GitHub Actions job that audits every `state.json` for drift...

[... full existing body remains exactly as written ...]

## 2. Summary Card

[The legacy in-body summary section can either stay (read by humans browsing the .md
directly) or be deleted in favor of the rendered <SummaryCard /> above. Recommended:
keep for the first wave; remove on a later pass once the rendered card is trusted.]

## 3. The Gemini audit — inputs, process, and one learning-loop discovery

[... unchanged ...]

## 4. The eight defenses of v7.5

[... unchanged ...]

## 5. How a new feature is now measured (end-to-end data flow)

## 6. What earned the bump from v7.1 to v7.5

{/*
=== ALTERNATIVE A — DESIGN NOTES ===

What changed:
  1. Frontmatter expanded with: tldr, key_numbers, honest_disclosures, kill_criterion_fired.
     These are the inputs the rendered <SummaryCard /> reads.
  2. Three MDX components rendered above the body: <SummaryCard />, <KillCriterionFired />,
     <DeferredItem /> (one per honest disclosure).
  3. Body untouched. Section 1-9 reads identically to the v7.5 ship.

What stays the same:
  - The 276-line narrative body.
  - The case-study URL (still data-integrity-framework-v7.5-case-study).
  - Reading order: card first, then narrative.

Cost to migrate v2.0–v7.0 case studies:
  - Add ~6 frontmatter fields + 0–3 MDX component lines per file.
  - No body editing required.
  - One new MDX component to build (SummaryCard + KillCriterionFired + DeferredItem
    is one component bundle in fitme-story).

Comparison table at /control-room/case-studies:
  - Auto-built at compile time from frontmatter across all 47+ files.
  - Sortable by version / work_type / kill_criterion_fired / ship_date.
  - Read-only roll-up of what each card already declares.
