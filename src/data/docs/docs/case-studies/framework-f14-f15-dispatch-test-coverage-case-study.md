# Framework F14/F15 — Dispatch-test coverage push

> **Live append-only journal.** Phase 8 (Docs) artifact authored 2026-05-23 immediately after implementation+testing+review approval (2026-05-22). T1/T2/T3 tier tags throughout: T1 (instrumented), T2 (declared / not yet measured), T3 (narrative). PR + merge sections will be appended at merge time — no retroactive edits.

## Section 0 — Genesis

Three converging pressures forced F14/F15 onto the v7.9 docket [T3]:

1. **The v7.8.3 silent-pass incident.** At v7.7 ship the `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6` gate had **0% effective coverage** because the gate read `created_at` while 43/46 state.json files used the legacy `created` key. Internal `check_cache_hits()` tests passed against synthetic input that already used `created_at`. Detection was post-hoc, via the 2026-04-30 audit. The fix at v7.8 (Mechanism A coverage-asserting gates + the v7.8.3 schema field-rename detection) closed the *detection* gap. But the underlying class of bug — a write-time gate dispatcher passing files past a check function that never gets called — remained un-tested. [T1, source: [`docs/case-studies/framework-v7-8-bridge-case-study.md`](framework-v7-8-bridge-case-study.md) §1, [framework honesty ledger FT2-FH-001](framework-honesty-ledger.md#ft2-fh-001)]
2. **The PR #317 reproducer.** On 2026-05-12 a similar dispatcher bug surfaced live: `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B never ran on infra-only commits because `main()` early-returned at `if not files: return 0` before reaching the gate dispatch site. Caught only because the operator deliberately reproduced the failure. PR #317 fixed the dispatcher AND added the first-ever `test_main_dispatch_<gate>()` end-to-end test — proving the pattern works but leaving 15 other write-time gates with no dispatcher coverage. [T1, source: PR #317 commit `97af469`]
3. **The v7.9 promotion deferral trade-off.** The 2026-05-15 prioritization decision per [`must-have-cadence-followups.md`](../../.claude/shared/must-have-cadence-followups.md) §C1 explicitly deferred this work to 2026-05-22 (T+1d post-v7.9) so the 9 new test fixtures would not write `candidate` rows into `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` during the v7.9 calibration window. The trade-off was conscious: v7.9 promoted 3 gates **without** dispatch tests on 9 sibling gates, and the v7.9.1 cycle (2026-06-04 → 06-11) will re-evaluate whether the promoted gates need to re-flip. F14/F15 is the validation work that should have been done *before* v7.9 promotion in a counterfactual world where the calibration baseline wasn't already running. [T1, source: [cadence-followups §C1](../../.claude/shared/must-have-cadence-followups.md) deferral note]

## Section 1 — Scope (9 gates × 1 dispatch test each)

Per [PRD §2](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/prd.md):

**F14 (4 gates, internal-only test today):**

| # | Gate | Source | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` (renamed from `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6` at v7.8.3) | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | write-time |
| 2 | `CU_V2_INVALID` | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | write-time |
| 3 | `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK` | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | write-time |
| 4 | `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS` | `scripts/check-case-study-preflight.py` | write-time |

**F15 (5 gates, zero coverage today):**

| # | Gate | Source | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | `PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG` | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | write-time (v7.6 enforced) |
| 6 | `PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING` | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | write-time (v7.6 enforced) |
| 7 | `BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL` | `scripts/integrity-check.py` | cycle-time (v7.8.1 advisory) |
| 8 | `BRANCH_ISOLATION_LAUNCHD_DRIFT` | `scripts/integrity-check.py` | cycle-time (v7.8.1 advisory) |
| 9 | `PR_CACHE_STALE` | `scripts/ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py` | operability (v7.8.4) |

**Out of scope (explicitly deferred):** F16 try-repo end-to-end harness, F17 `last_fired_at` per-gate index, F18 mutation testing, T1 `GATE_TEST_MISSING` meta-gate (RICE 53.3 — backlog ticket opened by this feature), uniform `dispatch.py` refactor for `ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py`, dispatch tests for the other 6 enforced gates (`SCHEMA_DRIFT`, `PR_NUMBER_UNRESOLVED`, `BROKEN_PR_CITATION`, `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_TIER_TAGS`, `ISOLATION_OPT_OUT_REASON_MISSING`, `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS`). [T1, source: [PRD §2 Out of scope](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/prd.md)]

## Section 2 — Locked decisions ([PRD §4](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/prd.md))

| OQ | Decision | Rationale (1-line) |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 cycle-time gate file | New `scripts/tests/test_integrity_check_dispatch.py` | Dispatch tests follow their gate's source script — `integrity-check.py` vs `check-state-schema.py` |
| Q2 `PR_CACHE_STALE` refactor | One-off `test_ensure_pr_cache_fresh.py` | Refactor to uniform-`dispatch.py` deferred to v8.x; avoids inflating effort 7-9h → 2-3d |
| Q3 `GATE_TEST_MISSING` meta-gate | Defer to test-coverage-master-plan T1 (RICE 53.3) | Backlog ticket opened by this feature; meta-gate implementation requires F14 reaching Phase E first |
| Q4 fixture sharing | New `scripts/tests/conftest.py` with `make_valid_state_json`, `make_invalid_state_json` (9 violation recipes), `tmp_gate_coverage_ledger`, `tmp_pr_cache_file` | Canonical pytest pattern; gives future T1 meta-gate a single inventory read point |

## Section 3 — Implementation (Phase 4) [T1]

Implementation landed in **two commits across one wall-clock day** (2026-05-22):

| Commit | Tasks | Files | Tests added | Wall-clock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `35ca182` — *conftest + 6 of 9 dispatch tests* | T1, T2, T4–T7 | `scripts/tests/conftest.py` (NEW, 330 lines), `scripts/tests/test_check_state_schema.py` (extended) | 6 (CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT, CU_V2_INVALID, STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK, PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG, PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING + pilot pattern validation T2) | ~3.5h (incl. fixture iteration) |
| `c790564` — *T3 + T8 + T9 + T10 complete — 9/9 dispatch tests landed* | T3, T8, T9, T10 | `scripts/tests/test_check_case_study_preflight.py` (NEW, 48 lines), `scripts/tests/test_integrity_check_dispatch.py` (NEW, 239 lines), `scripts/tests/test_ensure_pr_cache_fresh.py` (NEW, 151 lines) | 3 (CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS via preflight test file, BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL, BRANCH_ISOLATION_LAUNCHD_DRIFT, PR_CACHE_STALE) | ~1.5h |

[T1, source: `git log feature/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` from `main..HEAD`]

**Final file inventory under `scripts/tests/`:**

```
conftest.py                                    NEW   330 lines  (4 fixtures + 9 violation recipes)
test_check_case_study_preflight.py             NEW    48 lines  (1 test)
test_check_state_schema.py                     EXT  +6 tests in existing 663-line file
test_integrity_check_dispatch.py               NEW   239 lines  (2 tests)
test_ensure_pr_cache_fresh.py                  NEW   151 lines  (1 test)
```

[T1, source: `wc -l scripts/tests/*.py`]

**Pattern validation (T2 pilot):** `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK` was the chosen pilot because (a) simplest gate logic — single boolean check, (b) zero external dependencies, (c) deterministic synthetic input. T2 passed cleanly on first run → the monkey-patch pattern was proven before scaling to T3–T10. No backtracking required. [T3]

## Section 4 — Test phase verification (Phase 5) [T1]

T11 acceptance criteria from [tasks.md §T11](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/tasks.md):

| Criterion | Target | Observed | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pytest scripts/tests/ -v` exit code | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| All 9 new tests visible in output | 9/9 | 9/9 | ✓ |
| Test-suite total wall time | ≤ 55s | **10.82s** | ✓ |
| Per-test runtime | ≤ 500ms | observed ~10–110ms each (T1, 6 dispatch tests = ~90ms total in initial batch) | ✓ |
| Mechanism A canonical ledger mtime unchanged after test run | mtime preserved | mtime preserved (K3 guardrail) | ✓ |
| Pre-commit hook still passes on the worktree | green | green (35ca182 + c790564 both committed under live hooks) | ✓ |

[T1, source: `state.json::phases.testing.ci_passed_evidence` + pre-commit hook output captured in commits]

**Test count totals:** 161 tests pass in 10.82s in the full `scripts/tests/` suite. The 9 new tests contribute ~90–150ms in aggregate. Test suite headroom remains ~44s before the K2 30s-regression line. [T1]

**Ledger isolation guard:** Every dispatch test monkey-patches `GATE_COVERAGE_LEDGER` (or the per-script equivalent module attribute) to a `tmp_path / "gate-coverage.jsonl"` fixture and asserts at teardown that the canonical `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` mtime is unchanged. K3 guardrail enforced at the fixture level — no test can accidentally write to the canonical ledger without the assertion firing. [T1, source: [`conftest.py::tmp_gate_coverage_ledger`](../../scripts/tests/conftest.py)]

## Section 5 — Coverage delta [T1]

Per [PRD §3 success metrics](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/prd.md):

| Surface | Baseline (2026-05-22 pre-feature) | Post-feature (2026-05-22 evening) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write-time gates | **1/16 = 6%** (only `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B from PR #317) | **8/16 = 50%** (+ 7 from this feature: CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT + CU_V2_INVALID + STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK + CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS + PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG + PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING + PR_CACHE_STALE) | +44 pp |
| Cycle-time advisory gates | **0/3 = 0%** | **2/3 = 67%** (+ BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL + LAUNCHD_DRIFT) | +67 pp |
| **Combined (19 total)** | **1/19 = 5%** | **10/19 = 53%** | **+48 pp** |

[T1, source: test file inventory crosswalk against gate list in [CLAUDE.md "Write-time gates"](../../CLAUDE.md)]

The remaining 9/19 uncovered gates fall into three buckets, all explicitly out of scope per PRD §2:

- **6 enforced write-time gates** with no dispatch test (`SCHEMA_DRIFT`, `PR_NUMBER_UNRESOLVED`, `BROKEN_PR_CITATION`, `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_TIER_TAGS`, `ISOLATION_OPT_OUT_REASON_MISSING`, `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS`) — sequential backlog after T1 meta-gate ships
- **1 cycle-time advisory** with no dispatch test (`FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` cycle-time mirror) — sequenced after the F14/F15 write-time pattern proves out in v7.9.1 soak
- **2 gates without Mechanism A telemetry** (covered here via adapted assertion shape — see Section 6)

## Section 6 — Honest limitations [T3]

Two limitations the implementation explicitly acknowledged:

### 6.1 Two gates lack Mechanism A telemetry

`CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS` and `PR_CACHE_STALE` do not currently emit `{candidates, checked, skipped}` rows to `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl`. The standard PRD §5.1 test pattern asserts a row landed in the tmp ledger; for these two gates the assertion is adapted to verify the gate fired via `main()` exit code only (no Mechanism A row assertion possible until the gates emit coverage telemetry). [T1, source: [`state.json::phases.review.risks`](../../.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/state.json)]

Adding Mechanism A emission to these two gates is a v8.x backlog item — not blocking this feature, but flagged in the review-phase risks list so the T1 meta-gate (when built) knows to treat these two gates as a special case. [T3]

### 6.2 `current_phase` was not advanced through testing/review during implementation

Per CLAUDE.md `PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG` + `PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING` enforcement, every `current_phase` mutation requires a contemporaneous log event + timing entry. The implementation session advanced per-phase `status` fields (`implementation: in_progress → approved`, `testing: pending → approved`, `review: pending → approved`) but kept `current_phase: implementation` to avoid triggering the gates without operator-driven phase advancement. The phase transitions to `documentation` (and later `merge`) will be deliberate, log-paired, and timing-paired at the appropriate operator approval points. [T1, source: `state.json::phases.*.status` vs `current_phase`]

The uncommitted in-flight diff at 2026-05-22 session close also introduced a **duplicate `"review"` JSON key** in state.json — one with `status: approved` (newly added) and one with `status: pending` (stale from the initial state.json scaffold). JSON parses it but the second key silently overrides the first, which is exactly the failure mode the v7.7 → v7.8 schema-rename mechanisms (Mechanism B dual-read, Mechanism A coverage gates) exist to surface. The duplicate was cleaned up in the Phase 8 docs commit before any state.json gate evaluated it. [T1, source: 2026-05-23 docs-commit diff]

### 6.3 `ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py` does not share the canonical `dispatch.py` pattern

The PR_CACHE_STALE gate runs in a different script (`ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py`) with its own minimal dispatch shape — `CACHE_FILE` module attribute, file mtime check, exit code only. T10 adapted around this via `os.utime()` simulation on a `tmp_pr_cache_file` fixture, but the long-term cleanup is a uniform-dispatch refactor that would let one shared `dispatch.py` helper handle gate-coverage emission + main() entry consistently across all 3 source scripts. Deferred to v8.x per PRD §4 OQ2. [T3]

## Section 7 — Cross-feature impact

- **No production code changed.** This feature adds tests only. The `BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE` flag at `scripts/check-state-schema.py:132` is unchanged. The v7.9 promotion (PR #417) holds. [T1, source: `git diff main...feature/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` — only `scripts/tests/*` + `.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/*` changed]
- **Mechanism A baseline preserved.** No `candidate` rows written into the canonical `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` during the entire implementation window. K3 guardrail held. [T1, source: T11 verification]
- **Sets up T1 meta-gate.** The new `conftest.py` is the canonical inventory location for the future `GATE_TEST_MISSING` meta-gate (test-coverage-master-plan §2.2, RICE 53.3). T1 can read the test inventory programmatically and surface any new gate added without a corresponding `test_main_dispatch_<gate>()`. Backlog ticket opened by this feature in [`docs/product/backlog.md`](../product/backlog.md). [T2 — meta-gate not yet implemented]
- **v7.9.1 promotion criterion #1 retroactively satisfied.** v7.9 promoted three advisory gates without dispatch tests on 9 sibling gates. This feature retroactively closes the validation gap that was deferred from the 2026-05-21 freeze. The v7.9.1 cycle re-evaluation (2026-06-04 → 06-11) can now read this case study as evidence the deferred work landed. [T2]

## Section 8 — Lessons (Phase 9 prep) [T3]

Three observations worth carrying forward to v7.9.1 and v8.x planning:

1. **Deliberate trade-offs leave audit trails.** The 2026-05-15 deferral decision was documented in cadence-followups §C1 with explicit reasoning ("preserve the v7.9 calibration baseline — adding 9 new test fixtures would write ≥9 new candidate rows during the calibration window"). When v7.9 shipped without dispatch tests on these 9 gates and the v7.9.1 cycle had to re-evaluate, the trade-off was already on the record. *Pattern: when a v.X gate ships without its companion test work, write down WHY now, not at the next audit.*
2. **Pilot tests catch monkey-patch pattern issues cheaply.** T2 (`STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK`) was the cheapest possible gate to test end-to-end, deliberately chosen to validate the monkey-patch pattern before scaling. T2 passed cleanly → T3–T10 followed without backtracking. *Pattern: when adopting a new test pattern across N tests, pick the simplest N=1 case first and ship it as a standalone PR-equivalent commit.*
3. **Branch isolation worked exactly as designed.** This is a `work_subtype: framework_feature`, and every commit touched `scripts/tests/*` (infra-glob) + `.claude/features/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage/*` (state). Mode B fired on every commit, the auto-isolation flow had already placed the work in `/Volumes/DevSSD/FitTracker2-infra-dispatch-test-coverage`, and no main-branch contamination was even possible. *Pattern: the v7.9 enforcement flip on BRANCH_ISOLATION had its first real-world workout on this feature and held. No incidents.*

## Section 9 — Open commitments (review cadence) [T2]

| Date | Action | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **2026-06-01** (T+7d post-implementation) | Verify K1/K2/K3 not fired; CI green; runtime within budget | PRD §3 |
| **2026-06-21** (T+30d) | Verify K4 not fired; Mechanism A weekly scan shows real production fires on all 9 gates (or documented absence — gate didn't have a violation to catch in the window) | PRD §3 |
| **2026-08-22** (T+90d) | Final lagging-indicator review; close case study; populate `kill_criteria_resolution` frontmatter; transition `current_phase` → `complete` (subject to FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS gate) | PRD §3 |

## Section 99 — Synthesis (pending — populated at T+90d 2026-08-22)

> Section deliberately empty until the 90-day lagging-indicator review. At that point the kill-criteria resolution, the Mechanism A telemetry on the 9 covered gates over a real production window, and the T1 meta-gate status will be available to retroactively assess whether this feature delivered the silent-pass-incident reduction it targeted.

**Related PRs:** [PR #451](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/451) — squash-merged 2026-05-23 as `86084c4`. The implementation work was carried by two commits on `feature/framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` (`35ca182` + `c790564`) plus the Phase 8 docs commit (`d08a6ed`); two clean rebases onto fresh main (concurrent-session activity moved main twice) were required before the merge cleared branch protection.
