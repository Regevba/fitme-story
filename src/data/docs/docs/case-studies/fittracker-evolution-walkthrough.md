# FitTracker Evolution Walkthrough

**Date written:** 2026-04-01

This document explains the project in plain language: where it started, why it changed, how the product and design system evolved, and what is approved today.

It is written for contributors, reviewers, design collaborators, and anyone who needs to understand the project without reading raw git history first.

## 1. Starting point

FitTracker began as a promising SwiftUI fitness app with strong ambitions:
- training tracking
- nutrition logging
- recovery awareness
- progress review
- secure personal data handling

The app already had meaningful product depth, but the experience was not yet unified. Different screens were improving at different speeds, shared design rules were limited, and the relationship between design, runtime truth, and docs was still loose.

In practical terms, the project needed not just new features, but a better way to evolve safely.

## 2. The first major product shift: make the app feel like one product

The first big redesign wave focused on the user-facing product itself.

Core screens were rebuilt around a clearer idea:
- Home should help the user understand today, not browse endlessly
- Training should feel like an active workout companion
- Nutrition should support goals and quick logging, not just static food entry
- Stats should tell a progress story instead of acting like a placeholder dashboard

This stage gave the product stronger purpose, but it also revealed a new problem: the app was improving faster than the system around it.

## 3. Auth and settings needed a second pass

As the core product improved, auth and settings became more important.

Two issues stood out:
- auth had to feel more trustworthy, simpler, and more Apple-native
- settings had to support a growing product without collapsing into one oversized form

That led to:
- a cleaner auth hub with login and create-account modes on one surface
- stronger Apple Sign In and passkey support
- grouped Settings architecture with clearer categories and better navigation

This made the app easier to use, but it also made the need for a true design system much more obvious.

## 4. Why the design-system phase happened

By this point, the app had meaningful UI progress, but there was too much local styling and too much branch drift.

The team needed:
- semantic tokens
- shared reusable components
- a documented design language
- a safe review workflow
- a reliable way to keep Figma and code synchronized

That is why the Apple-first design-system phase began.

It introduced:
- semantic color and type roles in code
- shared primitives for cards, buttons, badges, menus, metrics, and states
- governance and contribution rules
- a Figma library that could evolve with the codebase
- a screen-by-screen approval workflow instead of one large uncontrolled UI branch

## 5. Why the branching strategy changed

One of the most important process shifts was moving away from a mixed UI branch and into clearer branch ownership.

The work was split into:
- a shared UI foundation branch
- dedicated screen branches for auth, home, training, nutrition, stats, and settings

This helped the team:
- isolate shared system work from screen-specific work
- approve screens one at a time
- avoid losing progress in a giant mixed branch
- promote approved work into a single integrated branch later

That integrated branch became:
- `codex/ui-integration`

## 6. Screen-by-screen approval and reverse-sync

The project then shifted into a more disciplined loop:
- compare current code, branch truth, and screenshots
- choose the real source of truth for one screen
- refine the screen
- verify it in simulator
- sync it back into Figma as an editable asset
- lock the screen before moving on

That workflow produced approved baselines for:
- Login
- Home
- Training
- Nutrition
- Stats
- grouped Settings

This was a major turning point. Figma stopped being just a design reference and became part of the product-review workflow.

## 7. Why Figma became part of the source of truth

The team needed to be able to do two things at once:
- review the app as it actually exists
- keep it editable for future design work

That is why the live Figma file was organized around:
- Foundations
- Components
- Patterns
- product-area pages
- integrated runtime boards

The approved screens were reverse-synced into Figma as live editable assets, not just screenshots. That made it possible to:
- review visual truth
- preserve design flexibility
- document system usage in the same place
- prepare for future prototyping and platform adaptation

## 8. The Apple-first integration phase

After the screen approvals, the next challenge was integration.

Approved screens existed, but they still needed to behave like one coherent app. That led to the Apple-first integration phase on `codex/ui-integration`.

This phase focused on:
- bringing approved screens together
- checking shell consistency
- standardizing review criteria
- aligning integrated runtime and Figma boards
- strengthening the design-system guidance layer

Major outcomes:
- integrated simulator review mode
- editable integrated runtime boards in Figma
- stronger Foundations guidance for color, typography, spacing, and UX copy
- clearer acceptance criteria for closing the Apple-first phase

## 9. What is approved today

As of the current integration branch, the approved Apple-first product baseline includes:
- Login
- Home
- Training
- Nutrition
- Stats
- grouped Settings

The system around those screens also exists:
- semantic tokens
- reusable shared UI primitives
- Figma live assets
- review standards
- acceptance checklists
- design-system progress memory

## 10. What still remains in the current phase

The current phase is close, but not completely closed.

The remaining closure work is:
- final integrated runtime proof at the same standard for every approved screen
- final expansion and polish of the live iPhone prototype in Figma
- final merge-package documentation and draft PR polish

Those items matter because they turn the Apple-first phase from “good internal progress” into a reviewable, merge-ready product baseline.

The prototype itself is no longer theoretical. A first live prototype layer now exists in the Figma file, built from approved integrated runtime boards and extended with representative grouped Settings detail states. The remaining work is about interaction depth, state coverage, and final closure quality.

## 11. What comes after this phase

Once the Apple-first phase is fully closed and merged, the next major work should be:
- App Store and launch-asset preparation
- continued documentation and merge hygiene
- Android / Pixel adaptation from the same semantic system

The goal is not to fork a second product language. The goal is to adapt the same semantic system safely to a second platform.

## 12. Related repository note

There is a separate related repository inside the workspace:
- [FitMe GDPR Docs README](FitMe-GDPR-Docs/README.md)

That repository is for legal/privacy drafting and review. It should be linked from the product repository when needed, but it should not be treated as part of the main product-evolution story.
