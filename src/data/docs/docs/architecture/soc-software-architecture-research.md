# SoC-on-Software Architecture Research

> **Status:** All 8 items IMPLEMENTED (Items 1+2 in v5.0, Items 3-8 in v5.1). Framework at v5.1.
> **Context:** PM hub v4.2 → v5.0 → v5.1 acceleration path.
> **Impact:** ~54K tokens reclaimed (items 1+2) + dispatch reduction, serialization elimination, cost optimization, latency reduction, bottleneck elimination (items 3-7).

## Problem Statement

The PM hub v4.2 framework costs ~96K tokens to fully load (~48% of 200K practical context). To continue the efficiency trend (6.5h → 1h across v2.0 → v4.2), the next leap requires architectural innovation — not just process refinement.

## Framework Context Budget (measured)

| Layer | Tokens | % of Total |
|---|---|---|
| 11 SKILL.md files | 38,537 | 40% |
| Cache (L1/L2/L3) | 32,010 | 33% |
| Integration adapters | 16,999 | 18% |
| Shared data layer | 8,649 | 9% |
| **Total** | **96,195** | **~48% of 200K** |

## 7 Hardware Principles → Software Optimizations

### 1. Apple LoRA Adapter Hot-Swap → Skill-on-Demand Loading

Apple loads ~10MB LoRA adapters dynamically per task over one base model. Hub equivalent: load only the 1-2 relevant SKILL.md files per invocation instead of all 11.

- **Saves:** ~30K tokens/session
- **Effort:** Low (routing logic in hub)
- **Mechanism:** `skill-routing.json` already knows which skills each phase needs. Add a `load_skills` field per phase; hub loads only those.

### 2. Apple Palettization (3.7-bit avg) → Cache Compression

Apple compresses 3B params to 3.7 bits/weight via K-means palettization. Hub equivalent: add `compressed_view` field to each cache entry (~200 word summary). Load compressed view in Phase 1; expand only if deeper investigation needed.

- **Saves:** ~24K tokens
- **Effort:** Low (add field to cache schema)
- **Mechanism:** Each L1/L2/L3 cache entry gets a `compressed_view` (≤200 words). Hub loads compressed views by default. `expand_cache: true` flag loads full entries when needed.

### 3. TPU Weight-Stationary Dataflow → Template-Stationary Batch Audits

TPU loads weights once, streams unlimited data through. Hub equivalent: load audit pattern set once, process N screens as data stream. 5x fewer dispatches for N-screen tasks.

- **Saves:** 5x fewer dispatches for batch operations
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Mechanism:** New `batch_audit` command in hub. Load template once → iterate screens as data.

### 4. M-series UMA Zero-Copy → Result Forwarding

UMA eliminates CPU/GPU memory copy. Hub equivalent: pass skill output inline (in context) to next skill instead of write-to-JSON-read-back cycle.

- **Saves:** Eliminates serialization overhead
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Mechanism:** Skill chain protocol where output stays in context window. Shared layer becomes write-back target only (like a register file).

### 5. ANE Mixed Precision → Model Tiering

ANE uses FP16 for bulk, FP32 for accuracy-critical. Hub equivalent: sonnet for mechanical tasks, opus for judgment tasks.

- **Saves:** Cost + latency on mechanical work
- **Effort:** Low (already partially doing this)
- **Mechanism:** Add `model_tier` field to `skill-routing.json`. Mechanical phases (token checks, file generation) use sonnet; judgment phases (architecture, review) use opus.

### 6. Branch Prediction → Speculative Cache Pre-loading

When `/ux` runs, pre-load `/design` cache because design always follows UX. Validated by arxiv paper 2510.04371 ("Speculative Actions").

- **Saves:** 30-40% latency reduction on skill chains
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Misprediction cost:** ~3K tokens (1.5% of budget)
- **Mechanism:** `speculative_preload` map in `skill-routing.json` — each skill declares likely successors.

### 7. TPU Systolic Array → Skill Chain Pipeline Protocol

Each skill receives only upstream output + own L1 cache. No global reads mid-execution. Shared layer becomes write-back target only.

- **Saves:** Eliminates Amdahl's Law bottleneck on sequential chains
- **Effort:** High (protocol redesign)
- **Mechanism:** Full pipeline protocol where skills are isolated execution units.

## Prioritized Implementation Order

| 2 | Cache compression (compressed_view) | ~24K/session | Low | **Implemented (v5.0)** |
| 3 | Batch skill invocation | 5x fewer dispatches | Medium | **Implemented (v5.1)** |
| 4 | Result forwarding | Eliminates write-read cycle | Medium | **Implemented (v5.1)** |
| 5 | Model tiering | Cost savings | Low | **Implemented (v5.1)** |
| 6 | Speculative pre-loading | 30-40% latency | Medium | **Implemented (v5.1)** |
| 7 | Systolic chain protocol | Eliminate global reads | High | **Implemented (v5.1)** |
| 8 | Hybrid task dispatch (big.LITTLE) | Complexity-aware parallel/serial | Medium | **Implemented (v5.1)** |

**All 8 items implemented. Items 1+2 reclaim ~54K tokens (27% of context window). Items 3-7 add dispatch reduction, serialization elimination, cost optimization, latency reduction, and bottleneck elimination. Item 8 adds complexity-aware lane routing.**

## Item 8 (Planned): ARM big.LITTLE → Hybrid Task Dispatch

ARM big.LITTLE uses heterogeneous cores: P-cores (Performance) for heavy threads, E-cores (Efficiency) for light threads. OS scheduler classifies each thread and routes accordingly.

Hub equivalent: classify each ready task by complexity before dispatch. Route lightweight tasks to a parallel lane (E-core) and heavyweight tasks to a serial lane (P-core).

- **Saves:** Parallel execution of lightweight tasks clears backlog faster; heavyweight tasks get full attention without interference
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Mechanism:** `task_complexity_gate` in `skill-routing.json`. Classification heuristics: files_changed, new models/services, token budget estimate, cross-feature deps, judgment intensity. Threshold: any 2 heavyweight indicators → serial lane. Composes with model tiering (item 5) — lightweight→sonnet, heavyweight→opus.
- **Execution order:** Parallel lane first (fast), then serial lane
- **Status:** **Implemented (v5.1)**

## Next Steps
