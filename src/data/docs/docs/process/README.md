# Process Documentation

Operational playbooks and groundwork tied to the 2026-04-21 Google Gemini 2.5 Pro independent audit. Each doc describes the **status** and **current limits** of the named Tier recommendation from that audit, not just what's aspirational.

> **State at v7.7 (Validity Closure, shipped 2026-04-27):** four of the original Tier recommendations are now formalized as **mechanically unclosable Class B gaps** — v7.7 closed one (cache_hits writer-path) via `CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6` pre-commit hook, reducing the count from 5 to 4. Their status will not "complete" because they cannot be mechanized without lying about what the framework can verify. See [`docs/case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md`](../case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md). v7.7 case study: [`docs/case-studies/framework-v7-7-validity-closure-case-study.md`](../case-studies/framework-v7-7-validity-closure-case-study.md).

## Contents

| File | Gemini Tier | Status (2026-04-25 at v7.6 ship) | Primary tooling |
|---|---|---|---|
| [runtime-smoke-gates.md](./runtime-smoke-gates.md) | **2.1** — Gated phase transitions with runtime smoke tests | Groundwork shipped; staging `app_launch` + `sign_in_surface` passing. **Real-provider checklist is now Class B Gap 4** — physical-device necessity, manual quarterly cadence | `make runtime-smoke PROFILE=<id> MODE=<local\|staging>` + `scripts/runtime-smoke-gate.py` |
| [contemporaneous-logging.md](./contemporaneous-logging.md) | **2.2** — Contemporaneous logging replacing retroactive case studies | Used end-to-end during v7.6's own session (9+ events). Cache-hits writer-path closed via `--cache-hit` flag (issue #140 resolved at writer-path). **Adoption stays Class B Gap 1** | `scripts/append-feature-log.py` writing to `.claude/logs/<feature>.log.json` |
| [documentation-debt-dashboard.md](./documentation-debt-dashboard.md) | **3.2** — Documentation debt dashboard | Baseline dashboard shipped; weekly cron (v7.6 Phase 2c) appends history snapshots; trend mode unlocks after 3 scheduled cycle snapshots | `make documentation-debt` + `.claude/shared/documentation-debt.json` |
| [product-management-lifecycle.md](./product-management-lifecycle.md) | — (pre-existing) | Canonical 10-phase PM lifecycle definition | `/pm-workflow <feature>` skill |

## Status reading guide

The audit's 9 Tier 1/2/3 items carry honest state labels so a reader never sees "done" when the recommendation is only partially implemented:

- **Shipped** — the recommendation is fully implemented and enforced
- **Subset shipped** — a narrower version of the recommendation is implemented; the broader form is explicitly deferred
- **Groundwork shipped** — infrastructure is ready but a manual or wall-clock blocker prevents full adoption
- **Pilot active** — convention is in use but not yet repo-wide
- **Baseline-only** — single-point measurement exists; trend analysis requires more data
- **Partial** — a component shipped but system-wide adoption is incomplete
- **Backlog** — deferred; typically external or multi-session work

## Adding a new process doc

If a new Tier recommendation surfaces a process change, add the doc here and:

1. Open with a one-line status line so readers know what to expect
2. Declare the current blocker openly — don't round up partial work to "shipped"
3. Cross-link to tooling (Makefile targets, scripts, config) by absolute path
4. Update this README's contents table in the same commit
