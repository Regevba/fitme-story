# Skills Changelog

> Append-only per-skill changelog for `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Closes P1.5 from [`docs/skills/skills-review-2026-05-13.md`](skills-review-2026-05-13.md). Bumped whenever a SKILL.md's `framework_version:` or `last_updated:` frontmatter changes, OR when a sub-command is added / removed / renamed.

## Convention

Each entry follows:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — vX.Y.Z (PR #NNN)

- Change 1 (one line, declarative)
- Change 2
```

Versioning rules (P2.5):

- `framework_version:` — mirrors the host framework version at write time (currently `v7.8.6`)
- A `vMAJOR.MINOR` bump corresponds to: sub-command add/remove/rename, mode change (active ↔ stable ↔ planned ↔ deprecated), or significant body restructure
- `last_updated:` bumps on ANY change, including frontmatter-only edits

---

## v7.8.6 group bump (2026-05-15)

Two PRs touched every SKILL.md `framework_version:` field:

- **PR #367** — bumped 11 SKILL.md (`pm-workflow`, `ux`, `design`, `dev`, `qa`, `analytics`, `cx`, `marketing`, `ops`, `release`, `research`) `framework_version: v7.8.5 → v7.8.6` and `last_updated: 2026-05-14 → 2026-05-15`. No body changes.
- **PR #368** (this PR) — bumps `/brainstorm-pm` SKILL.md `framework_version: v7.8.5 → v7.8.6` (skipped by #367 because brainstorm-pm was added the day before the v7.8.6 cycle started; this PR aligns it with the other 11). Also adds the missing `docs/skills/brainstorm-pm.md` public docs page closing the docsHref gap.

No sub-command changes. No mode changes. Pure metadata sync against the v7.8.6 cadence batch (`make integrity-diff`, `make preflight WORK_TYPE=<type>`, weekly Mechanism A zero-drift, W1 ssh preflight) which adds NO new gates — every addition is a read/diff/warn surface. See [`evolution.md`](evolution.md) v7.8.6 row for the full ship narrative.

## `/brainstorm-pm` (NEW)

### 2026-05-15 — v7.8.6 (PR #368)

- `framework_version: v7.8.5 → v7.8.6`, `last_updated: 2026-05-14 → 2026-05-15` (closes the gap left by PR #367 which only touched 11 SKILL.md files).
- New `docs/skills/brainstorm-pm.md` public docs page (mirrors research.md format: role / 4 modes as sub-commands / when-to-use vs `superpowers:brainstorming` / 4 frameworks per mode / shared data / PM workflow integration / standalone examples / recent usage). Closes the `docsHref` gap from the 2026-05-14 sweep where the SKILL.md existed but no public docs page did, surfaced during the 2026-05-15 fitme-story `/pm-flow` audit.
- Companion: fitme-story PR #114 registers `/brainstorm-pm` as the 12th brick in `src/lib/skill-ecosystem.ts` (was missing — caused the visible 11-vs-12 drift on `/pm-flow` Scattered view).

### 2026-05-14 — v7.8.5 (PR #350)

- **NEW skill** (P1.0b). Modeled on Anthropic's `product-brainstorming` from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins`.
- 4 modes: problem / solution / assumption / strategy.
- 4 frameworks: HMW / JTBD / First Principles / OST.
- Wired into pm-workflow Phase 0 as the default new-feature entry point.
- Output contract: writes to `state.json::brainstorm.<mode>` which becomes input to Phase 1 PRD sections.
- (P1.4) `adapters_used: []` (no external adapters).

## Integration adapter changelog

Tracks frontmatter changes to `.claude/integrations/{adapter}/adapter.md`. Same convention as skills.

### 2026-05-14 — all 6 adapters (this PR)

Added P1.4 frontmatter (`name`, `type`, `consumed_by`, `last_updated`) to:

- `app-store-connect` — `consumed_by: [cx, release, marketing]`
- `axe` — `consumed_by: [ux, qa, design]`
- `firecrawl` — `consumed_by: [research, marketing]`
- `ga4` — `consumed_by: [analytics, pm-workflow, cx]`
- `security-audit` — `consumed_by: [dev, ops, qa]`
- `sentry` — `consumed_by: [ops, cx, qa]`

Bidirectional integrity (each `consumed_by` entry matches the corresponding skill's `adapters_used`) is verifiable by hand today; a follow-up PR will add a `W5` check to `scripts/skills-audit.py` once PR #350 + #352 land (to avoid merge conflicts).
