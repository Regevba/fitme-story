## 1. Why This Exists

**Problem:** The original `/pm-workflow` (v1.2) was the only skill, doing everything inline — research, PRD writing, task breakdown, UX specs, code review, testing, deployment, and docs all lived in one monolithic skill definition. It worked, but it didn't scale:

- Adding a new domain (marketing, CX, ops) meant bloating one already-large file
- You couldn't use design audits or analytics validation without running a full PM cycle
- Cross-domain information stayed trapped inside one workflow's context

**Solution:** Hub-and-spoke architecture where each domain has its own skill, connected through a shared data layer.

**Result:** 11 skills (1 hub + 10 spokes) + 15 shared data files + 6 local integration adapters + MCP-backed external tool integrations + 3-level learning cache + automatic validation gate + self-healing health checks. Adding `/ux` in 2026-04-07 split the "what should this feature do?" planning concern out of `/design`, so `/design` now owns only the how-it-looks layer and `/ux` owns the what-and-why layer. The boundary is documented in §7.5. v3.0 (2026-04-09) added external tool sync, screen audit research mode, parallel subagent execution, and the sub-feature queue pattern. v4.0 (2026-04-10) introduced the reactive data mesh, integration adapter layer, automatic validation gate (GREEN/ORANGE/RED), and L1/L2/L3 learning cache. v4.1 (2026-04-10) added the Skill Internal Lifecycle (Cache Check → Research → Execute → Learn). v4.2 (2026-04-10) added the self-healing hub with Phase 0 health checks. v4.3 (2026-04-11) formalizes that operational extension: the control room, case-study monitoring, maintenance-program orchestration, and live external-sync monitoring are now part of the framework itself. v4.4 (2026-04-13) introduced eval-driven development — mandatory eval definitions for every feature, zero measurable overhead. v5.0 (2026-04-14) applies SoC-on-Software chip architecture principles: skill-on-demand loading (~30K tokens saved) and cache compression via compressed_view (~24K tokens saved), reclaiming ~54K tokens (27% of context window). v5.1 (2026-04-14) completes the SoC suite with 6 more optimizations: model tiering (ANE mixed precision), batch dispatch (TPU weight-stationary), result forwarding (UMA zero-copy), speculative cache pre-loading (branch prediction), systolic chain protocol (TPU systolic array), and task complexity gate (ARM big.LITTLE). Combined: 63% framework overhead reduction (121K → 45K tokens per phase). v5.2 (2026-04-16) adds two dispatch safety sub-projects: Sub-Project A (Dispatch Intelligence) introduces a 3-stage pipeline (score complexity → probe capability → dispatch with budget) with static complexity scoring, tool budgets (haiku=10, sonnet=25, opus=50), and permission-aware routing — cutting average tool usage by 48% and variance by 84%. Sub-Project B (Parallel Write Safety) adds snapshot/rollback and a 3-tier code region mirror pattern (agent-region markers → MARK sections → full file) with progressive marker learning, making parallel writes deterministic rather than luck-dependent. Config: `.claude/shared/dispatch-intelligence.json`.

**Key principle:** Every skill is a **Lego piece** (works alone) AND a **puzzle piece** (fits into the hub).

- **Lego piece** = self-contained unit with its own sub-commands, data reads/writes, and outputs. You can invoke `/cx reviews` or `/design audit` without touching the hub.
- **Puzzle piece** = follows a standard interface contract (reads shared JSON → does work → writes shared JSON → produces artifacts) so the hub can orchestrate skills in sequence.
- **The connector studs** = the shared data layer (`.claude/shared/*.json`). This is what makes skills interoperable — they don't call each other directly, they communicate through shared state.

## 2. The Evolution: v1.2 → v2.0

### What Changed

| Phase | v1.2 Behavior | v2.0 Behavior |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **0. Research** | Inline research template | Dispatches to `/research wide` + `/research narrow` + `/research feature`; pulls `/cx` signals and `/analytics` baselines |
| **1. PRD** | Inline PRD template + analytics gate | PRD template + dispatches to `/analytics spec` for instrumentation spec |
| **2. Tasks** | Inline task breakdown | Task breakdown + auto-assigns to `/dev`, `/design`, `/qa`, `/analytics` |
| **3. UX** | Inline UX spec + compliance gateway | Dispatches to `/design ux-spec` for UX spec, accessibility audit, component selection |
| **4. Implement** | Inline coding | Dispatches to `/dev branch`, code patterns, dependency check |
| **5. Test** | Inline CI check | Dispatches to `/qa plan` + `/qa run` for test plan, coverage check, regression |
| **6. Review** | Inline diff review | Dispatches to `/dev review` for code review + `/design audit` for visual review |
| **7. Merge** | Inline merge | Dispatches to `/release checklist` + `/release prepare` for version check, changelog |
| **8. Docs** | Inline doc update | Dispatches to `/marketing launch` for comms, `/cx roadmap` for support docs, `/analytics dashboard` |
| **9. Learn** | *Did not exist* | **NEW:** `/cx analyze` + `/analytics report` → assess → classify root cause → dispatch fix → loop until solved |

### The Big Shift: Linear Pipeline → Living Cycle

v1.2 was a pipeline that ended at Phase 8 (Docs). v2.0 adds Phase 9 (Learn), which makes the workflow **circular** — after shipping, the hub continuously monitors user feedback and metrics, classifies problems by root cause, and dispatches fixes to the responsible skill. The pipeline never truly ends; it feeds back into itself.

### Information Flow Protocol

Every skill follows the same contract:

1. **READS** from `.claude/shared/*.json` for context
2. **WRITES** its outputs back to `.claude/shared/*.json`
3. **PRODUCES** artifacts in `docs/` or `.claude/features/`
4. **REPORTS** status that other skills can query

---

## 5. The Lego Principle — Every Skill Stands Alone

### Dual-Use Design

Every skill in the ecosystem serves two roles:

**STANDALONE mode:** Invoke any skill directly for a specific task, without running a full PM cycle. The skill reads its needed context from shared data, does its work, writes its outputs, and reports results.

**INTEGRATED mode:** The hub (`/pm-workflow`) invokes skills automatically at the right phase. The skill receives the same context but as part of an orchestrated sequence.

### The Mechanism

What makes this work is the **shared data layer as connector studs**:

1. Every skill declares what it READS and WRITES (like Lego brick connection points)
2. Shared JSON files are the physical connections — they hold state between skill invocations
3. The hub orchestrates the ORDER of invocation, but each skill is self-sufficient

**Analogy:** A Lego brick (say, a 2x4) works perfectly as a standalone building block. But it also has a specific shape (interface) that lets it snap into a larger structure. The studs on top and tubes underneath are the shared data contracts.

### Why This Matters

- **Flexibility:** A solo founder can use `/design audit` at 2 AM without running a 10-phase cycle
- **Composability:** The hub can skip skills that aren't relevant to a particular feature
- **Extensibility:** Adding a new skill (e.g., `/legal`) means creating one SKILL.md and declaring its shared data reads/writes — no hub modification needed (graceful fallback)

---

## 6. /pm-workflow — The Hub

**What it does:** Orchestrates the complete product management lifecycle for a feature through 10 phases (0-9), dispatching to domain skills at each phase.

### Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `/pm-workflow {feature}` | Start or resume full lifecycle | "Start the onboarding feature" | N/A — this IS the hub |
| Phase transitions | Move between phases with approval gates | "Move to Phase 4" | Automatic at each gate |

### Shared Data

| Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|
| `context.json` (startup injection) | `feature-registry.json` (new features) |
| `feature-registry.json` (resume state) | Per-feature `state.json` |
| All shared files (phase-dependent) | Phase-specific outputs |

### Key Features

- **State management:** `.claude/features/{name}/state.json` tracks current phase, blockers, metrics, history
- **GitHub Issue sync:** Bidirectional sync between state.json and GitHub Issue labels (`phase:0-research`, etc.)
- **Approval gates:** Every phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding
- **Graceful fallback:** If a dispatched skill doesn't exist yet, falls back to inline behavior
- **Manual override:** "Move to {phase}" or "Roll back to {phase}" for flexibility

### Standalone Usage

```
/pm-workflow onboarding       → Start/resume the onboarding feature lifecycle
/pm-workflow training          → Check status of training (already shipped)
"Move to Phase 4"             → Skip ahead (with confirmation)
"Roll back to Phase 1"        → Revisit PRD (with confirmation)
```

### Hub Integration

This IS the hub. Every other skill is dispatched FROM here.

---

## 7. /design — Design & UX

**What it does:** Manages design system governance, creates UX specs from PRDs, generates Figma build prompts, validates the token pipeline, and enforces WCAG AA accessibility.

### Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `/design audit` | Design system compliance check | "Check if this PR's UI changes comply with the design system" | Phase 6 (Review) |
| `/design ux-spec {feature}` | Generate UX spec from PRD | "Create UX spec for the onboarding flow" | Phase 3 (UX) |
| `/design figma {feature}` | Generate Figma build prompt | "Generate Figma prompt for the stats redesign" | Phase 3 (UX) |
| `/design tokens` | Validate token pipeline | "Check if DesignTokens.swift matches tokens.json" | Phase 6 (Review) |
| `/design accessibility` | WCAG AA audit | "Run accessibility audit on the nutrition screens" | Phase 6 (Review) |

### Shared Data

| Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|
| `context.json` (brand, personas) | `design-system.json` (new tokens/components) |
| `design-system.json` (current inventory) | |
| `cx-signals.json` (UX confusion signals) | |

### Key References

- `FitTracker/Services/AppTheme.swift` — semantic token layer
- `FitTracker/DesignSystem/AppComponents.swift` — reusable components
- `docs/design-system/feature-development-gateway.md` — 7-stage workflow
- `docs/design-system/approval-process.md` — governance rules

### Standalone Usage Examples

1. **Quick compliance check:** `/design audit` → "I just changed the nutrition view, check if it follows the design system"
2. **UX for a new feature:** `/design ux-spec onboarding` → Generates full UX spec with all states, accessibility, and token mapping
3. **Figma automation:** `/design figma onboarding` → Generates a copy-paste prompt for Figma MCP

### Hub Integration

- **Phase 3 (UX):** Hub dispatches `/design ux-spec` and `/design figma`
- **Phase 6 (Review):** Hub dispatches `/design audit` for visual review

### Connections

- Receives UX confusion signals from `/cx` (via `cx-signals.json`)
- Feeds component specs to `/dev` (via `design-system.json`)
- Receives personas and brand from `/pm-workflow` (via `context.json`)
- **Receives UX research and specs from `/ux`** (via `ux-research.md` + `ux-spec.md` in `.claude/features/{name}/`)

---

## 7.5 /ux — UX Planning & Validation

**What it does:** Ensures every UI feature is grounded in research-backed UX principles *before* visual design or code implementation begins. `/ux` is the planning layer that feeds `/design` and `/dev` — the What & Why before the How it Looks and How it's Built.

**Added:** 2026-04-07 (PR #59) as the UX planning layer for the PM workflow hub. Pilot run was the Onboarding v2 UX Foundations alignment pass.

### Boundary: /ux vs /design

| Concern | `/ux` | `/design` |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| What & Why | User flows, behavior, heuristics, patterns | — |
| How it Looks | — | Tokens, components, Figma, compliance |
| Research | Principles, HIG, competitive UX | Market positioning, visual trends |
| Validation | Heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough | Token compliance, contrast, motion |
| Accessibility | Usability (clarity, cognitive load, feedback) | Technical (WCAG AA, VoiceOver, tap targets) |

**Handoff:** `/ux` produces `ux-research.md` + `ux-spec.md` → `/design` validates against the design system → `/dev` implements.

### Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `/ux research {feature}` | UX principle audit from the 13 ux-foundations heuristics (8 core + 5 FitMe-specific) | "Research UX principles for the training plan redesign" | Phase 3 (UX), **Phase 0 Research for v2 refactors** |
| `/ux spec {feature}` | Generate `ux-spec.md` with Principle Application Table, screen flows, and state coverage | "Create ux-spec for the stats hub" | Phase 3 (UX) |
| `/ux validate {feature}` | Heuristic evaluation of a proposed spec or shipped surface against ux-foundations.md | "Validate the current onboarding flow against Hick's Law" | Phase 3 (UX) and Phase 6 (Review) |
| `/ux audit` | Full UX audit — walks a v1 surface against ux-foundations.md and produces `v2-audit-report.md` with P0/P1/P2 severity and tractability tags | "Audit MainScreenView.swift for UX Foundations compliance" | **Phase 0 for v2 refactors** |
| `/ux patterns` | Surface existing FitMe interaction patterns for reuse before introducing new ones | "What existing patterns already handle a biometric entry flow?" | Phase 3 (UX) |

### Shared Data

| Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|
| `context.json` (personas, positioning) | `ux-research.md` in `.claude/features/{name}/` |
| `design-system.json` (current inventory) | `ux-spec.md` in `.claude/features/{name}/` |
| `docs/design-system/ux-foundations.md` (the 13 principles) | `v2-audit-report.md` in `.claude/features/{name}/` (refactors) |
| `.claude/features/{name}/research.md` (PRD research phase) | `docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md` Section A ticks |

- `docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md` — Sections A/E/F/G/H owned by `/ux`
- `docs/design-system/feature-development-gateway.md` — 7-stage workflow that `/ux` walks
- `docs/design-system/feature-design-checklist.md` — per-feature design checklist
- Apple HIG — external reference for iOS platform conventions

### Standalone Usage Examples

1. **Audit an existing screen before refactor:** `/ux audit` → "Audit `MainScreenView.swift` against `ux-foundations.md` and produce severity-graded findings for the v2 pass"
2. **Research principles for a new feature:** `/ux research barcode-scanning` → Identifies which of the 13 principles apply, cites HIG sources, flags risks
3. **Generate a ux-spec:** `/ux spec stats-hub-v2` → Creates `ux-spec.md` with Principle Application Table, 5-state coverage, and a11y requirements
4. **Validate a shipped surface:** `/ux validate settings` → Heuristic evaluation with concrete fix suggestions
5. **Find existing patterns:** `/ux patterns` → "Is there an existing inline-edit pattern I should reuse, or do I need a new one?"

### Hub Integration

- **Phase 0 (Research, v2 refactor only):** Hub dispatches `/ux audit` to produce `v2-audit-report.md` as the gap analysis that drives the rest of the lifecycle.
- **Phase 3 (UX Definition):** Hub dispatches `/ux research` → `/ux spec` → `/ux validate` in sequence. The design system compliance gateway (Phase 3) is where `/ux` handoff to `/design` happens.
- **Phase 6 (Review):** Hub dispatches `/ux validate` as a heuristic sanity check before merge approval, in parallel with `/design audit`.

### Connections

- **Feeds `/design`:** `ux-spec.md` is the input to `/design ux-spec` and `/design figma`. `/ux` defines the what; `/design` defines the how it looks.
- **Feeds `/dev`:** The Principle Application Table in `ux-spec.md` becomes the acceptance criteria that `/dev` implements against.
- **Receives from `/research`:** Competitive UX patterns surfaced by `/research narrow` feed `/ux research` as market context.
- **Receives from `/cx`:** UX confusion signals from `cx-signals.json` surface existing pain points that inform `/ux audit` findings.
- **Gates `/pm-workflow` Phase 3:** No UI feature advances from Phase 3 without an approved `ux-spec.md`. Non-skippable for new UI features (per the V2 Rule in CLAUDE.md).

- **Phase 5 (Test):** Hub dispatches `/analytics validate` for instrumentation verification
- **Phase 8 (Docs):** Hub dispatches `/analytics dashboard` for monitoring setup
- **Phase 9 (Learn):** Hub dispatches `/analytics report` for post-launch metrics

### Connections

- Reads qualitative context from `/cx` (via `cx-signals.json`) to correlate quant + qual
- Reads attribution from `/marketing` (via `campaign-tracker.json`)
- Feeds metric status to `/ops` for alert thresholds

### Naming Convention (project rule, established 2026-04-08)

Per the **Analytics Naming Convention** in `CLAUDE.md`, every event tied to a specific screen MUST start with that screen's prefix:

| Screen | Prefix | Example events |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `home_` | `home_action_tap`, `home_metric_tile_tap`, `home_empty_state_shown` |
| Nutrition | `nutrition_` | `nutrition_meal_logged`, `nutrition_macro_viewed`, `nutrition_scanner_opened` |
| Training | `training_` | `training_workout_start`, `training_set_completed`, `training_exercise_viewed` |
| Stats | `stats_` | `stats_period_changed`, `stats_chart_interaction`, `stats_metric_drill_down` |
| Settings | `settings_` | `settings_consent_updated`, `settings_account_deleted` |
| Onboarding | `onboarding_` | `onboarding_step_viewed`, `onboarding_step_completed` |
| Auth | `auth_` | `auth_signin_started`, `auth_signin_completed` |

**Exceptions:** Cross-screen lifecycle events (`app_open`, `session_start`, `sign_in`, `sign_up`) stay unprefixed. GA4-recommended events (`tutorial_begin`, `select_content`, `share`, `login`) keep their dictated names.

**Enforcement:**
- `/analytics spec` validates new events against the rule before writing the spec
- `/analytics validate` audits existing events and reports violations
- `analytics-taxonomy.csv` has a `screen_scope` column tracking the prefix scope per event
- The PM workflow Phase 1 Analytics Spec gate blocks PRD approval if any new event tied to a screen lacks its prefix

The rule lets anyone reading a GA4 dashboard or funnel report see the event's source screen at a glance — no source code lookup needed.

## 11. /cx — Customer Experience

**What it does:** The most complex spoke skill. Monitors App Store reviews with deep keyword analysis, runs NPS surveys, performs sentiment analysis with root cause classification, extracts testimonials, manages the public roadmap, and — most critically — runs post-deployment feedback loops that connect user signals back to original feature pain points.

### Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `/cx reviews` | Scrape and analyze reviews | "Analyze our latest App Store reviews" | Phase 0 (Research) |
| `/cx nps` | Design/analyze NPS survey | "Design an NPS survey for our active users" | Phase 8 (Docs) |

### Shared Data

| Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|
| `feature-registry.json` (pain points) | `cx-signals.json` (ALL fields) |
| `metric-status.json` (quant context) | |
| `health-status.json` (tech context) | |

### Deep Feedback Analysis Engine

The CX skill doesn't just categorize reviews — it classifies them by **signal type** and **root cause**:

**Signal Types:** Positive, Negative, Feature Request, Confusion, Friction, Comparison — each with specific keyword patterns stored in `cx-signals.json → keyword_patterns`.

**Root Cause Classification** (for negative/confusion signals):

| Root Cause | Example Signal | Dispatched To |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Messaging | "what does this do", "I thought it would..." | `/marketing` |
| UX | "how do I", "can't find", "confusing navigation" | `/design` |
| Functionality | "doesn't work", "broken", "bug" | `/dev` + `/qa` |
| Expectation mismatch | "I expected", "not what I wanted" | `/pm-workflow` |

### Post-Deployment Assessment Categories

| Assessment | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Solved** | Pain point eliminated | Celebrate, marketing fuel |
| **Improved** | Reduced but not eliminated | Plan iteration |
| **Status Quo** | No measurable change | Investigate discoverability/messaging |
| **Worsened** | New confusion introduced | UX emergency review |
| **New Problem** | Solved original, created new | New PRD cycle |

### Standalone Usage Examples

1. **Review analysis:** `/cx reviews` → "Paste our latest 50 App Store reviews" → Categorizes by signal type, extracts themes
2. **Feature health check:** `/cx analyze training` → "Did training solve 'Logging is tedious'?" → Assessment with evidence
3. **Weekly digest:** `/cx digest` → Aggregates all signals, highlights actionable items for PM

### Hub Integration

- **Phase 0 (Research):** Hub pulls CX signals for user pain points
- **Phase 8 (Docs):** Hub dispatches `/cx roadmap` for public roadmap
- **Phase 9 (Learn):** Hub dispatches `/cx analyze {feature}` — the feedback loop

## 16. The CX Feedback Loop (Phase 9: Learn)

Phase 9 is what makes the v2.0 pipeline **circular** instead of linear. After a feature ships (Phase 8: Docs), the hub enters a continuous monitoring phase.

### The Complete Feedback Cycle

```
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                  POST-DEPLOYMENT LOOP                     │

### Root Cause Classification

| Root Cause | Detection Signals | Dispatched To | What Happens |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Messaging** | "what does this do", "what is this for" | `/marketing` | Repositions feature messaging, A/B tests |
| **UX** | "how do I", "can't find", "confusing" | `/design` | Revises UX spec, triggers new design cycle |
| **Functionality** | "doesn't work", "broken", "bug" | `/dev` + `/qa` | Bug fix → test → hotfix release |
| **Expectation** | "I expected", "not what I wanted" | `/pm-workflow` | Re-scopes PRD, validates with `/research` |

### Assessment Flow

1. `/cx analyze {feature}` runs on every new review/feedback batch
2. `/analytics report` checks if success metrics hit targets
3. **Assessment:** solved / improved / status quo / worsened / new problem
4. If NOT solved → classify root cause → dispatch to responsible skill
5. Loop continues until assessment = "solved" or kill criteria triggered

This is what transforms FitMe's PM workflow from a "ship it and forget it" pipeline into a **learning organization** — every shipped feature generates data that improves the next feature.

## 19. Feature Review — Skills Ecosystem Lens

For each of the 16 features in `feature-registry.json`, here is the skill chain that would apply if built today with the v2.0 ecosystem.

### Shipped Features (10)

#### 1. Training Tracking (`training`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked | What Happens |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 0. Research | `/research feature training` | Teardown of Strong, Hevy, Fitbod logging UX |
| 1. PRD | `/analytics spec training` | Define: training_start, set_complete, session_end events |
| 3. UX | `/design ux-spec training` | Exercise picker, set logging, rest timer states |
| 4. Implement | `/dev branch training` | `feature/training` branch |
| 5. Test | `/qa plan training`, `/qa run` | Happy path, edge cases (empty gym, no exercises) |
| 6. Review | `/dev review`, `/design audit` | High-risk file scan, token compliance |
| 7. Merge | `/release checklist` | CI green, tests pass, analytics regression |
| 8. Docs | `/marketing launch training`, `/analytics dashboard training` | Launch comms, GA4 dashboard |
| 9. Learn | `/cx analyze training` | "Did it solve 'logging is tedious'?" |

**Gap:** None — fully covered by ecosystem.

#### 2. Nutrition Logging (`nutrition`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research feature nutrition`, `/research narrow nutrition-tracking` |
| 1 | `/analytics spec nutrition` |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec nutrition` (meal entry, macro display, supplement tracking) |
| 5 | `/qa plan nutrition` |
| 9 | `/cx analyze nutrition` ("Did it solve 'no connection to training'?") |

**Gap:** Nutrition ingestion is already wired for text search and barcode lookup. The remaining gaps are around recommendation quality, meal-timing analysis, and broader validation coverage.

#### 3. Recovery & Biometrics (`recovery`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research wide biometric-tracking`, `/research feature recovery-scores` |
| 1 | `/analytics spec recovery` |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec recovery` (HRV, sleep, RHR, readiness score) |
| 5 | `/qa plan recovery`, `/qa security` (HealthKit data is sensitive) |
| 9 | `/cx analyze recovery` ("Did it solve 'no way to know if body is ready'?") |

**Gap:** None — ecosystem handles HealthKit sensitivity via `/qa security`.

#### 4. Home / Today Screen (`home`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research wide decision-reduction` (Headspace, Duolingo daily screens) |
| 1 | `/analytics spec home` (sessions_per_day, training_cta_tap_rate) |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec home` (today view, quick actions, readiness card) |
| 9 | `/cx analyze home` ("Did it solve 'decision fatigue'?") |

**Gap:** None.

#### 5. Stats / Progress Hub (`stats`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research feature stats-dashboards` (Strong muscle heatmaps, Strava year-in-review) |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec stats` (charts, trends, PR tracking, body composition) |
| 9 | `/cx analyze stats` ("Did it solve 'no unified progress view'?") |

**Gap:** None.

#### 6. Authentication (`auth`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research wide auth-friction` (Signal passkeys, Apple Sign In patterns) |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec auth` (sign in, sign up, passkey, error states) |
| 5 | `/qa security` (JWT handling, passkey WebAuthn, session persistence, Keychain ACL) |
| 9 | `/cx analyze auth` ("Did it reduce signup abandonment?") |

**Gap:** Google Sign In listed as critical gap — would need `/research feature social-signin`.

#### 7. Settings (`settings`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 3 | `/design ux-spec settings` (preferences, data management, GDPR controls) |
| 5 | `/qa security` (account deletion GDPR, data export) |

**Gap:** Account deletion and data export listed as critical gaps — `/qa security` would catch these.

#### 8. Data & Sync (`data-sync`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research wide zero-knowledge-sync` (Signal protocol, end-to-end patterns) |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec data-sync` (sync indicator, conflict resolution UI) |
| 5 | `/qa security` (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 validation), `/qa plan data-sync` |
| 9 | `/cx analyze data-sync` ("Is sync reliable? Any data loss reports?") |

**Gap:** None — this is the most security-critical feature and `/qa security` covers it thoroughly.

#### 9. AI / Cohort Intelligence (`ai`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research wide federated-learning`, `/research feature ai-fitness-recommendations` |
| 1 | `/analytics spec ai` (recommendation_acceptance, confidence_score, escalation_rate) |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec ai` — AI insight surfaces are now shipped in Home and the full-sheet experience |
| 5 | `/qa plan ai`, `/dev perf` (AI latency, fallback behavior) |
| 9 | `/cx analyze ai` ("Are recommendations useful? Are users confused by AI suggestions?") |

**Gap:** The user-facing AI surface is shipped. The current AI gaps are recommendation analytics fidelity, feedback quality, and runtime validation of the on-device/cloud handoff.

#### 10. Design System v2 (`design-system`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked |
|-------|---------------|
| 0 | `/research ux-patterns design-systems` (Material Design, Human Interface Guidelines) |
| 3 | `/design tokens`, `/design audit` |
| 5 | `/qa run` (make tokens-check) |

**Gap:** None — the `/design` skill was literally built to manage this feature.

### Shipped (Measurement/Compliance/Tooling)

#### 11. Google Analytics (`google-analytics`) — SHIPPED

| Skills | `/analytics validate`, `/analytics dashboard`, `/qa run` (23 analytics tests) |
|--------|---|
| **Gap** | None — `/analytics` is purpose-built for this. |

#### 12. GDPR Compliance (`gdpr`) — SHIPPED

| Skills | `/qa security` (encryption audit, data exposure), `/design ux-spec` (consent UI) |
|--------|---|
| **Gap** | None. |

#### 13. Development Dashboard (`dashboard`) — SHIPPED

| Skills | `/ops health` (data sources), `/dev ci-status` |
|--------|---|
| **Gap** | None. |

#### 14. Android Design System (`android-ds`) — SHIPPED

| Skills | `/design tokens` (token mapping), `/research narrow android-fitness-apps` |
|--------|---|
| **Gap** | None — `design-system.json` already tracks 92 Android-mapped tokens. |

#### 15. Marketing Website (`marketing-website`) — IN PROGRESS

| Skills | `/marketing aso`, `/marketing content`, `/marketing screenshots`, `/analytics spec` (cta_click, section_view events) |
|--------|---|
| **Gap** | None. |

### Planned Features (1 in registry)

#### 16. Onboarding (`onboarding`) — SHIPPED

| Phase | Skills Invoked | What Happens |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 | `/research wide onboarding` | Duolingo value-first, Headspace immersive, Noom quiz-based |
| 0 | `/research feature onboarding` | 5+ app teardowns of fitness onboarding flows |
| 0 | `/cx reviews` | Pull any existing confusion signals about first-time experience |
| 1 | `/analytics spec onboarding` | completion_rate, d1_retention, healthkit_connect events |
| 1 | `/analytics funnel onboarding` | app_open → profile_setup → healthkit_connect → first_workout |
| 2 | Tasks → `/dev`, `/design`, `/qa`, `/analytics` | Auto-assign based on scope |
| 3 | `/design ux-spec onboarding` | Value-first flow, HealthKit permission, goal setting |
| 3 | `/design figma onboarding` | Figma build prompt for all onboarding screens |
| 4 | `/dev branch onboarding` | `feature/onboarding` |
| 5 | `/qa plan onboarding` | Happy path, skip flow, HealthKit denied, returning user |
| 6 | `/dev review`, `/design audit` | High-risk review (auth flow touched), visual compliance |
| 7 | `/release prepare` | Version bump for onboarding release |
| 8 | `/marketing launch onboarding` | In-app highlight, email to existing users, App Store update |
| 8 | `/analytics dashboard onboarding` | Completion funnel, D1 retention chart |
| 9 | `/cx analyze onboarding` | "Did it solve 'no guided first experience'?" |

**Gap:** Core onboarding is shipped. The remaining adjacent gap is the broader push-notification system, which sits outside onboarding itself.

### Critical Gaps Not in Feature Registry

These items from the roadmap are not tracked as features in `feature-registry.json`:

| Gap | Skills That Would Cover It |
|-----|---------------------------|
| **Account deletion (GDPR)** | `/qa security`, `/design ux-spec`, `/dev` |
| **Data export (GDPR)** | `/qa security`, `/design ux-spec`, `/dev` |
| **Auth runtime verification** | `/qa security`, `/dev`, `/ops health` |
| **Push notifications** | `/research wide push-notification-patterns`, `/design ux-spec`, `/dev`, `/marketing email` |
| **App icon + App Store assets** | `/design audit`, `/marketing screenshots`, `/release prepare` |
| **Import training plan** | `/research feature import-training-plan`, `/design ux-spec`, `/dev`, `/qa plan` |

### Ecosystem Coverage Summary

| Aspect | Coverage |
|--------|---------|
| Features fully covered | 14 of 16 (87.5%) |
| Features with gaps | 2 (AI — needs recommendation UI; Nutrition — needs food database/barcode) |
| Critical gaps addressable | All 8 gaps can be handled by existing skills |
| Skills with no feature gaps | `/design`, `/dev`, `/qa`, `/analytics`, `/ops`, `/release`, `/research` |
| Skill needing most future work | `/cx` (no real data yet — pre-launch) |

## 20. Key Design Decisions

1. **Shared data over direct calls:** Skills communicate through JSON files, not by invoking each other directly. This keeps skills decoupled and independently testable.

2. **Graceful fallback:** The hub checks if a skill exists before dispatching. If it doesn't, it falls back to inline behavior. This means you can incrementally add skills without breaking the pipeline.

3. **State in features/, context in shared/:** Per-feature state (phase, blockers) lives in `.claude/features/`. Cross-cutting context (metrics, brand, health) lives in `.claude/shared/`. This separation keeps feature work isolated while maintaining global awareness.

4. **Phase 9 is continuous, not one-time:** Unlike Phases 0-8 which are sequential gates, Phase 9 (Learn) runs indefinitely. The hub re-enters the loop on every new feedback batch until the feature is assessed as "solved."

5. **Every skill has standalone examples:** Not just "you can use this skill independently" but concrete invocations. This is critical for AI agents and new contributors who need to see exactly how to invoke a skill outside the hub.

## 21. Gap Analysis & Historical Snapshot

> Merged in from the former `docs/project/skills-ecosystem-analysis.md`
> (2026-04-04). That document was a bottom-up + top-down audit of every
> functional area — what existed, what was missing, and how complete a
> product org would compare. Many of its "Red" gaps have since been
> closed, so the content is preserved here as a historical record plus
> a running delta.

### 21.1 What existed on 2026-04-04

**Active skills + automations at snapshot time:**

| ID | Name | Type | Status then |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | `/pm-workflow` | Claude Code Skill (v1.2) | Shipped |
| H1 | SessionStart hook | Shell hook | Active |
| H2 | Stop hook (git check) | Shell hook | Active |
| A1 | Token pipeline (`make tokens`) | Makefile + Node | Active |
| A2 | Token drift detection (`make tokens-check`) | CI gate | Active |
| A3 | CI pipeline (build + test) | GitHub Actions | Active |
| A4 | Feature state tracking | JSON state machine | Active |
| A5 | Analytics instrumentation gate | PM Skill phase | Active |
| A6 | Design system compliance gateway | PM Skill phase | Active |
| A7 | GitHub Issue label sync | PM Skill automation | Active |

**Hand-authored prompts at snapshot time:** 8 prompts covering Figma prototype builds, iteration 2 batches, prototype audits, and Notion/Dashboard setup. All of these moved to `docs/prompts/` on 2026-04-08 and are the "hand-authored" section of that folder.

### 21.2 What's changed since 2026-04-04

The 2026-04-04 snapshot showed 24% overall ecosystem coverage (8 Green / 11 Yellow / 39 Red across 58 functional areas). Since then:

| Area | 2026-04-04 status | Current status | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Design & UX → UX research & principles** | Yellow (inline) | **Green** (`/ux` skill shipped 2026-04-07) | +1 skill |
| **Development → Release management** | Red | **Green** (`/release` skill shipped) | +1 skill |
| **QA → Unit testing** | Green | Green | — |
| **Analytics → Event taxonomy** | Green | Green | — |
| **CX → Review monitoring, NPS, sentiment, keyword analysis** | Red (10 items) | **Green** (`/cx` skill shipped with 7 sub-commands) | +1 skill covering 7 items |
| **Marketing → SEO, content, social, email, referrals, ASO** | Red (mostly) | **Green** (`/marketing` skill shipped with 7 sub-commands) | +1 skill |
| **Operations → Incident response, monitoring, cost** | Red | **Green** (`/ops` skill shipped) | +1 skill |
| **Research → Cross-industry, competitive, market** | Not listed | **Green** (`/research` skill shipped) | +1 skill |
| **Dashboard** | Red (no visibility) | **Green** (Development Dashboard shipped v1.1 on 2026-04-08 with live state.json + autonomous label sync) | +1 feature |

The skill count went from **1** (just `/pm-workflow`) at snapshot time to **11** today (10 spokes + the hub). Most of the Red items in Part 2 of the original analysis are no longer Red — they're covered by one of the spokes.

### 21.3 Still-open gaps (priority-ordered)

These are the gaps from the 2026-04-04 analysis that remain as of the current review:

| # | Area | Subarea | Current status | Why still open |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dev → Error tracking (Crashlytics/Sentry) | Red | Still Red | No crash reporting wired yet. High priority before App Store launch. |
| 2 | QA → UI testing (XCUITest) | Red | Still Red | Unit tests cover logic but no screenshot or flow tests. |
| 3 | Analytics → A/B testing framework | Red | Still Red | No feature-flag infra. Deferred to post-launch. |
| 4 | Analytics → Funnel analysis | Red | Still Red | GA4 taxonomy is in place but dashboards haven't been built. |
| 5 | PM → Sprint/iteration planning | Red | Still Red | `/pm-workflow` handles phases, not sprints. May never need sprint planning in this product. |
| 6 | PM → Stakeholder updates | Red | Still Red | `/ops digest` is planned but not shipped. |
| 7 | Design → Visual regression testing | Red | Still Red | Considered low priority for a solo-dev project. |
| 8 | Marketing → Referral program | Red | Still Red | Depends on install base; premature. |

The remaining items from the 2026-04-04 analysis are either addressed by an existing skill (just not wired to a feature yet) or intentionally deferred as "post-launch only".

### 21.4 FitMe's unique advantages (benchmark vs fitness app peers)

Industry benchmark from the 2026-04-04 analysis, with current delta:

| Practice | Strava | MyFitnessPal | Hevy | FitMe (then) | FitMe (now) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CI/CD pipeline | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Automated testing | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Partial** | **Partial** (unit only) |
| Feature flags | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **No** |
| A/B testing | Yes | Yes | No | **No** | **No** |
| Crash monitoring | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **No** |
| Review monitoring | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **Skill shipped** (`/cx reviews`) |
| ASO automation | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **Skill shipped** (`/marketing aso`) |
| Email marketing | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** | **Skill shipped** (`/marketing email`) |
| NPS/CSAT | Yes | Yes | No | **No** | **Skill shipped** (`/cx nps`) |
| Design system CI | No | No | No | **Yes** (unique) | **Yes** (unique) |
| PM lifecycle skill | No | No | No | **Yes** (unique) | **Yes** (unique, now with 11-skill ecosystem) |
| Analytics instrumentation gate | No | No | No | **Yes** (unique) | **Yes** (unique) |
| **UX Foundations v2 refactor flow** | No | No | No | — | **Yes** (unique, shipped 2026-04-08) |

**FitMe's unique advantages:** design system CI, PM lifecycle automation, analytics instrumentation gate, UX Foundations per-screen refactor pass. All four are genuinely novel.

**FitMe's remaining gaps vs peers:** crash monitoring, feature flags, UI test automation. These are the pre-launch priorities.

### 21.5 Historical system map (from the 2026-04-04 analysis)

The original analysis drew the ecosystem as a single hub with missing side-layers. It's included here for comparison with the current hub-and-spoke architecture in §3:

## 22. v3.0 — Skill Dispatch Model, External Sync & V2 Pipeline (2026-04-09)

### Skill dispatch model

```text
USER
  │
  ▼
/pm-workflow (HUB)
  │
  ├──▶ Skill dispatch (spoke selection by phase)
  │      ├──▶ /ux audit        (Phase 0 v2)
  │      ├──▶ /ux spec         (Phase 3)
  │      ├──▶ /ux wireframe    (Phase 3)
  │      ├──▶ /design build    (Phase 4)
  │      ├──▶ /dev branch      (Phase 4)
  │      ├──▶ /qa plan         (Phase 5)
  │      └──▶ /analytics spec  (Phase 1)
  │
  ├──▶ External tool sync (on every phase transition)
  │      ├──▶ GitHub Labels    (gh CLI)
  │      ├──▶ Notion MCP       (notion-update-page)
  │      ├──▶ Figma MCP        (get_design_context)
  │      └──▶ Vercel           (deploy preview)
  │
  └──▶ Shared data layer (.claude/shared/*.json)
         └──▶ change-log.json broadcast → all skills notified
```

### V2 refactor pipeline

The end-to-end pipeline for screen-level UX alignment passes:

```text
1. /ux audit (Phase 0)
   └──▶ v2-audit-report.md (numbered findings, P0/P1/P2 severity)

2. /ux spec + /ux wireframe (Phase 3)
   └──▶ ux-spec.md with Principle Application Table + ASCII wireframes

3. /design build (Phase 4)
   └──▶ Figma MCP design context → SwiftUI implementation in v2/ subdirectory

4. /qa plan + /analytics validate (Phase 5)
   └──▶ 37+ analytics tests, functional tests, v2-refactor-checklist verification

5. /dev review (Phase 6)
   └──▶ project.pbxproj swap: v1 out of Sources, v2 in
```

### Parallel execution model

During Phase 4, independent tasks dispatch to multiple subagents simultaneously:

- Tasks grouped by skill (e.g., `/dev` tasks T1-T3 in parallel with `/design` task T9)
- Dependency graph computed from `state.json.tasks[].depends_on`
- Ready set recomputed after each task completion
- All parallel streams converge at Phase 5 (Test) gate

### Memory system integration

The shared data layer (`.claude/shared/`) serves as the ecosystem's memory:

- `feature-registry.json` — what exists and its status (read by all skills)
- `change-log.json` — what happened and when (audit trail)
- `context.json` — who we are and what we're building (product identity)
- Per-feature `state.json` — where each feature is in its lifecycle

Skills never call each other directly. All inter-skill communication flows through these shared files, making the system debuggable (inspect any JSON file to see the current state) and recoverable (restart from any `state.json` checkpoint).

---

## 9. Reactive Data Mesh (v4.0)

> **Added:** 2026-04-10 | **Principle:** "Any entry point, any time, data flows."

v3.0 was a closed loop — all data originated from manual work inside conversations. v4.0 opens the system to external data sources via MCPs and APIs, adds automatic validation, and introduces a learning cache that accelerates repeated tasks.

### 9.1 Core Principle

The system is NOT a batch pipeline where data is fetched once and consumed linearly. It is a **reactive mesh** where:

1. **Every MCP/API is an open port.** The moment a new source is connected (e.g., Sentry MCP gets configured), data starts flowing into the shared layer immediately — not waiting for a PM workflow phase to "request" it.
2. **Data enriches retroactively.** Plugging in App Store Connect doesn't just help the next `/cx` run — it backfills `cx-signals.json` with real reviews that validate (or contradict) assumptions already in `feature-registry.json`.
3. **Any skill can be the trigger.** Running just `/analytics validate` (single skill, no hub) still pulls live GA4 data through the adapter. That data updates `metric-status.json`, which is read by `/qa`, `/cx`, `/ops`, and `/pm-workflow`.
4. **The hub orchestrates, but doesn't gatekeep data.** `/pm-workflow` sequences phases and gates approvals, but data flows through the shared layer independently of phase progression.

### 9.2 Integration Adapter Layer

External data enters through adapters at `.claude/integrations/{service}/`:

```
.claude/integrations/
├── _template/           ← boilerplate for new integrations
│   ├── adapter.md       ← how to call the MCP/API
│   ├── schema.json      ← expected response shape
│   └── mapping.json     ← field mapping to shared layer
├── ga4/                 ← GA4 Analytics MCP
├── app-store-connect/   ← App Store Connect MCP (208 tools)
├── sentry/              ← Sentry Error Tracking MCP
├── firecrawl/           ← Web Scraping MCP
├── axe/                 ← Accessibility Audit MCP
└── security-audit/      ← Dependency Security MCP
```

**Why adapters?** Isolation. If GA4 MCP changes its response format, you update one `mapping.json`, not every skill that consumes analytics data. Skills never call MCPs directly — they go through the adapter contract.

**Adapter contract:** `Raw MCP response → schema.json (validate shape) → mapping.json (normalize fields) → validation gate → shared layer`

### 9.3 Integration Map

| Adapter | MCP Package | Consuming Skills | Shared Layer Target |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ga4 | `mcp-server-ga4` | /analytics, /pm-workflow, /cx | metric-status.json |
| app-store-connect | `asc-mcp` | /cx, /release, /marketing | cx-signals.json, feature-registry.json |
| sentry | `mcp.sentry.dev` | /ops, /cx, /qa | health-status.json, cx-signals.json |
| firecrawl | `firecrawl-mcp` | /research, /marketing | context.json, feature-registry.json |
| axe | `@anthropic-ai/mcp-axe` | /ux, /qa, /design | design-system.json, test-coverage.json |
| security-audit | `mcp-security-audit` | /dev, /ops, /qa | health-status.json, test-coverage.json |
| figma | (already connected) | /design | design-system.json |
| linear | (official hosted) | /pm-workflow | feature-registry.json, task-queue.json |
| notion | (already connected) | /pm-workflow | feature-registry.json |

### 9.4 Automatic Validation Gate

All data entering the shared layer passes through an automatic validation gate. The gate cross-references every field in the incoming data against existing shared layer state.

**Validation score** = consistent fields / total comparable fields

```
         ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │         AUTOMATIC VALIDATION GATE                  │
         │                                                    │
         │   ≥ 95%  GREEN   Write. Notify skill + hub.       │
         │   90-95% ORANGE  Write + advisory. Review later.   │
         │   < 90%  RED     DO NOT write. STOP. User resolves.│
         └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scoring rules:**

| Check Type | Consistent? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Numeric within 5% tolerance | Yes |
| Categorical exact match | Yes |
| New field (null → value) | Always yes (gap fill) |
| Measured superseding estimated | Always yes |
| Two measured sources disagree | No (conflict) |

**Notification recipients (always two):**
1. **Receiving skill** — the skill whose data flow triggered ingestion
2. **/pm-workflow** — always informed for project-level awareness

**The validation is automatic. Resolution is always manual.** The system never silently resolves conflicts or auto-corrects data. It surfaces what happened, who's affected, and the options — then waits for the user.

**Validation log entries** are written to `.claude/shared/change-log.json` with: timestamp, source, receiving_skill, validation_score, alert_level, action_taken, fields_checked, discrepancies, and notifications_sent_to.

### 9.5 Configuration

Integration sources and validation thresholds are declared in `.claude/shared/skill-routing.json` (v4.3 schema):

- `integration_sources` — maps each skill to `local_adapters`, `external_connectors`, `shared_reads`, and `shared_writes`
- `validation_gate` — thresholds (green: 0.95, orange: 0.90), numeric tolerance (0.05), auto-write levels, manual resolution levels

## 10. Learning Cache (v4.0)

> **Added:** 2026-04-10 | **Inspiration:** CPU cache hierarchy (L1/L2/L3) + browser cache (key/hit/TTL)

### 10.1 Why

When skills perform complex multi-step work (e.g., applying UX foundations across screens), each execution previously started from scratch. The 4th screen took as long as the 1st. The cache stores patterns, decisions, and outcomes so similar tasks accelerate over time.

### 10.2 Cache Hierarchy

```
.claude/cache/
├── _index.json              ← master index (schema, lifecycle rules)
├── {skill}/                 ← L1: per-skill, hot
│   ├── _index.json          ← skill-level index
│   └── {pattern}.json       ← cached patterns
├── _shared/                 ← L2: cross-skill, warm (2+ skills share)
│   └── {pattern}.json
└── _project/                ← L3: project-wide, cold (5+ skills share)
    └── {pattern}.json
```

| Level | Scope | Promotion Rule | Example |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------|
| L1 | Single skill | Default home for new patterns | `/design` token mapping decisions |
| L2 | 2+ skills | Promoted from L1 when pattern spans skills | UX foundations application playbook |
| L3 | 5+ skills | Promoted from L2 when widely referenced | Hub-and-spoke architectural conventions |

### 10.3 Cache Entry Structure

```json
{
  "cache_key": "{skill}:{task_type}:{context}",
  "skill": "string | null (L2/L3)",
  "level": "L1 | L2 | L3",
  "created": "ISO 8601",
  "last_hit": "ISO 8601",
  "hit_count": 0,
  "ttl_strategy": "until_invalidated",
  "invalidated_by": ["file_path:sha256"],
  "task_signature": { "type": "", "inputs": [], "context": "" },
  "learned_patterns": [{ "pattern": "", "decision": "", "confidence": "", "source_executions": [] }],
  "anti_patterns": [{ "pattern": "", "what_went_wrong": "", "source_execution": "" }],
  "speedup_instructions": "How to use this cache to go faster"
}
```

### 10.4 Cache Lifecycle

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Skill execution starts | Check `_index.json` for matching `task_signature`. If hit → load patterns, skip derivation. |
| Skill execution completes | Extract patterns + anti-patterns. Write/update cache entry. Increment `hit_count`. |
| Source file changes | Check `invalidated_by` SHA256 hashes. Mismatch → mark stale, re-derive next use. |
| Cross-skill pattern | 2+ L1 entries share pattern → promote to L2 (`_shared/`). |
| Project-wide pattern | L2 entry referenced by 5+ skills → promote to L3 (`_project/`). |

### 10.5 Speedup Example

Applying UX foundations to 4 screens:

| Screen | Cache State | Savings |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Home (1st) | Cold — full derivation | 0% |
| Training (2nd) | Warm — token map + component selection cached | ~40% |
| Nutrition (3rd) | Hot — anti-patterns from 2 prior screens loaded | ~55% |
| Stats (4th) | Hot — only novel layout patterns need derivation | ~65% |

### 10.6 Skill Internal Lifecycle

> **Principle:** Every skill mirrors the hub's structure internally. The hub has 10 phases; each skill has 4 internal phases that run on every invocation.

Every skill — whether invoked standalone (`/design audit`) or dispatched by the hub (`/pm-workflow` Phase 3 → `/design`) — follows this internal lifecycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   SKILL INTERNAL LIFECYCLE                       │
│                                                                  │
│  ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐  │
│  │ 1. CACHE │───▶│2. RESEARCH│───▶│3. EXECUTE│───▶│ 4. LEARN │  │
│  │  CHECK   │    │  (if     │    │          │    │          │  │
│  │          │    │  needed) │    │          │    │          │  │
│  └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘  │
│       │               │               │               │        │
│  Read L1/L2/L3   Investigate     Do the work      Write back   │
│  for matching    tools, APIs,    using cached +    patterns,    │
│  task signature  MCPs, methods   researched        anti-patterns│
│                  if cache miss   knowledge         to L1 cache  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Phase 1: CACHE CHECK

Before doing any work, the skill checks for prior learnings:

1. Read `.claude/cache/{skill}/_index.json` — check for matching `task_signature`
2. Read `.claude/cache/_shared/` — check for cross-skill patterns
3. Read `.claude/cache/_project/` — check for project-wide conventions

**If cache hit:** Load `learned_patterns`, `anti_patterns`, and `speedup_instructions`. Skip to Phase 3 (Execute), using cached knowledge as the foundation. This is why the 4th screen refactor is 65% faster than the 1st.

**If cache miss:** Proceed to Phase 2 (Research).

#### Phase 2: RESEARCH (if needed)

When the cache doesn't have an answer, the skill enters research mode. What "research" means varies by skill domain:

| Skill | What It Researches |
|-------|-------------------|
| `/design` | Token inventory, component catalog, Figma patterns, new design tools, foundation changes |
| `/ux` | UX principles, accessibility standards, wireframe patterns, usability research methods |
| `/dev` | Implementation approaches, dependency options, API changes, security best practices |
| `/qa` | Test strategies, coverage tools, regression patterns, CI pipeline configurations |
| `/analytics` | Event naming conventions, GA4 API capabilities, dashboard templates, funnel patterns |
| `/research` | Competitor apps, market data, industry trends, user behavior patterns |
| `/cx` | Review sentiment patterns, feedback classification, root-cause dispatch rules |
| `/marketing` | ASO strategies, campaign templates, content formats, distribution channels |
| `/ops` | Monitoring tools, incident patterns, threshold configurations, alert strategies |
| `/release` | App Store submission rules, TestFlight configs, versioning patterns, fastlane setups |
| `/pm-workflow` | Phase gating patterns, work type selection, cross-skill orchestration strategies |

Research sources (checked in order):
1. **Shared layer** — read `.claude/shared/*.json` for existing project state
2. **Integration adapters** — pull live data from connected MCPs/APIs via `.claude/integrations/`
3. **Codebase** — read source files, configs, existing implementations
4. **External** — web search, documentation, API docs (only if above sources insufficient)

Research outputs a set of **decisions** — which tool to use, which approach to take, which pattern to follow. These decisions become the inputs to Phase 3.

#### Phase 3: EXECUTE

Do the actual work using:
- Cached patterns from Phase 1 (if cache hit)
- Research decisions from Phase 2 (if cache miss)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (from cache or research)

This is where the skill's sub-command logic runs — the part that was there before v4.0. The difference: it now operates with pre-loaded context instead of deriving everything from scratch.

#### Phase 4: LEARN

After execution completes, the skill extracts what it learned:

1. **Patterns** — what approach worked, what tools were used, what decisions were made
2. **Anti-patterns** — what was tried and failed, what was caught in review
3. **Speedup instructions** — how to skip steps next time for a similar task
4. Write/update L1 cache entry in `.claude/cache/{skill}/`
5. If a pattern overlaps with another skill's L1 cache → flag for L2 promotion

**The learning step is mandatory.** Every skill invocation — even a simple one — should check if it learned something new. The cache only gets smarter if skills write back.

#### Why This Matters

Without the internal lifecycle, skills are stateless functions — they produce the same output but never get faster. With it:

- **1st invocation** — full research, full execution, cold cache (slow)
- **2nd similar invocation** — cache hit on patterns, skip research, faster execution
- **Nth similar invocation** — hot cache, anti-patterns loaded, execution focused only on what's novel

This is the same principle as the hub's Phase 9 (Learn) feedback loop, but applied at the individual skill level rather than the feature lifecycle level.

### 10.7 Skill Contract Update

Every SKILL.md now includes these sections:

1. **External Data Sources** — which adapters to check, when to pull live data
2. **Cache Protocol** — Phase 1 (cache check) and Phase 4 (learn) behavior
3. **Research Scope** — what this skill investigates during Phase 2 when cache misses
4. **Cross-Skill Cache Promotion** — when a pattern should be promoted to `_shared/`

## 12. v5.0 — SoC-on-Software: Skill-on-Demand Loading & Cache Compression (2026-04-14)

> **Inspiration:** Apple silicon System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture principles applied to software framework design.
> **Research:** `docs/architecture/soc-software-architecture-research.md`
> **Savings report:** `docs/architecture/soc-savings-report-v5.1.md`

### 12.1 The Problem

By v4.3, the framework loaded all 11 SKILL.md files (~30K tokens) and all cache entries (~24K tokens) at session start, regardless of which phase was active. This consumed ~54K tokens (27% of a 200K context window) before any work began.

### 12.2 Item 1: Skill-on-Demand Loading (~30K tokens saved)

**Inspiration:** Apple's LoRA adapter hot-swap — load only the model weights needed for the current task.

Instead of loading all 11 SKILL.md files, the hub loads only the 1-2 skills relevant to the current phase. Configuration lives in `skill-routing.json` → `phase_skills`:

```json
"phase_skills": {
  "research":          { "skills": ["research", "cx"] },
  "prd":               { "skills": ["pm-workflow", "analytics"] },
  "implementation":    { "skills": ["dev", "design"] },
  "testing":           { "skills": ["qa", "analytics"] },
  ...
}
```

### 12.3 Item 2: Cache Compression (~24K tokens saved)

**Inspiration:** Apple's 3.7-bit palettization — reduce model weight precision for deployment.

Each cache entry gains a `compressed_view` field (~200 words) loaded by default. Full cache expansion only happens on demand when the skill needs detailed patterns. The `compression_version` field tracks which version generated the compression.

### 12.4 Combined Impact

~54K tokens reclaimed (27% of 200K context window). The framework went from consuming 28% of context to ~1% for framework overhead.

---

## 13. v5.1 — Complete SoC Suite (2026-04-14)

6 additional chip-architecture-inspired optimizations shipped on top of v5.0's 2 items:

### 13.1 Item 3: Batch Dispatch (TPU Weight-Stationary)

Load a skill template once, iterate over N targets as data. For a 6-screen audit, this means 7 reads instead of 12 reads + 5 fewer hub dispatch cycles.

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `batch_dispatch.supported_operations`

### 13.2 Item 4: Result Forwarding (UMA Zero-Copy)

Pass skill output inline to the next skill instead of write-to-disk-then-read-back. Shared layer becomes write-back only (for audit trail). The next skill detects `_forwarded_from` flag and skips disk read.

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `result_forwarding.eligible_chains`

### 13.3 Item 5: Model Tiering (ANE Mixed-Precision)

Use sonnet (fast, cheap) for mechanical tasks (file generation, label updates, CSV sync) and opus (deep reasoning) for judgment tasks (architecture decisions, code review, UX evaluation). Per-phase tier recommendations in `phase_skills`.

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `model_tiering.tiers`

### 13.4 Item 6: Speculative Preload (Branch Prediction)

Pre-load likely-next-skill cache when the current skill runs. A `successor_map` defines prediction chains with confidence scores. Misprediction cost: ~3K tokens (1.5% budget).

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `speculative_preload.successor_map`

### 13.5 Item 7: Systolic Chains (TPU Systolic Array)

In a defined chain (e.g., v2 refactor pipeline: audit → spec → compliance → prompt), each skill receives ONLY upstream output + its L1 cache. No global shared-layer reads mid-chain. Write-back happens after the entire chain completes.

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `systolic_chains.defined_chains`

### 13.6 Item 8: Task Complexity Gate (big.LITTLE Hybrid Dispatch)

Classify each ready task as lightweight (E-core, parallel, sonnet) or heavyweight (P-core, serial, opus). Lightweight tasks run first to clear the backlog quickly, then heavyweight tasks run with full attention.

**Config:** `skill-routing.json` → `task_complexity_gate.classification`

### 13.7 Combined v5.0 + v5.1 Impact

~63% framework overhead reduction. See `docs/architecture/soc-savings-report-v5.1.md` for detailed token impact analysis.

## 15. Cross-Domain Application: AI Engine Architecture Adaptation

The PM-flow framework patterns have been applied beyond the development workflow itself — to the product's in-app AI engine. This is documented in:

The adaptation maps framework patterns to product architecture:

| PM-flow Pattern | AI Engine Analog | File |
|---|---|---|
| Integration Adapter (`.claude/integrations/`) | `AIInputAdapter` protocol + 4 concrete adapters | `FitTracker/AI/Adapters/` |
| Validation Gate (GREEN/ORANGE/RED) | `ValidatedRecommendation` with `ConfidenceLevel` (.high/.medium/.low) | `FitTracker/AI/ValidatedRecommendation.swift` |
| Learning Cache (L1/L2/L3) | `RecommendationMemory` (on-device, encrypted, LRU) | `FitTracker/AI/RecommendationMemory.swift` |
| Shared Data Layer | `LocalUserSnapshot` (already existed) | `FitTracker/AI/AITypes.swift` |
| Hub orchestration | `AIOrchestrator` (already existed, now with GoalProfile) | `FitTracker/AI/AIOrchestrator.swift` |
| Phase 9 Feedback Loop | Thumbs up/down → `RecommendationMemory` | `FitTracker/Views/AI/AIInsightCard.swift` |
| Goal-aware weighting | `GoalProfile` maps `NutritionGoalMode` → `MetricDriver` weights | `FitTracker/AI/GoalProfile.swift` |

This represents the first case where framework patterns crossed from "how we build" into "what we build."
