## What it does

Manages everything outbound: ASO, paid campaigns, organic content, email drips, launch comms, and App Store creative. Takes inputs from `/cx` (testimonials, user language) and `/research` (competitive positioning) and produces campaign briefs, content briefs, email sequences, and App Store listings.

## Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/marketing aso` | App Store listing optimization | "Optimize our App Store listing for 'fitness tracker AI'" | Pre-launch |
| `/marketing campaign {name}` | Create campaign brief | "Create a campaign for our launch week" | Phase 8 (Docs) |
| `/marketing competitive` | Competitive analysis | "How does our positioning compare to Hevy and Strong?" | Phase 0 (Research) |
| `/marketing content {topic}` | SEO content brief | "Write a content brief about progressive overload tracking" | Continuous |
| `/marketing email {sequence}` | Email automation | "Design the onboarding email drip" | Phase 8 (Docs) |
| `/marketing launch {feature}` | Launch communications | "Prepare launch comms for the AI recommendations feature" | Phase 8 (Docs) |
| `/marketing screenshots` | App Store screenshots | "Spec out our App Store screenshots" | Pre-launch |

## Shared data

**Reads:** `context.json` (brand, personas, positioning), `cx-signals.json` (testimonials, user language), `metric-status.json` (conversion, retention), `feature-registry.json` (what's launched).

**Writes:** `campaign-tracker.json` (campaigns, UTM convention, channels, attribution model).

## PM workflow integration

| Phase | Dispatches |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 (Research) | `/marketing competitive` for positioning context |
| Phase 8 (Docs) | `/marketing launch` for feature announcement comms |

## Upstream / Downstream

- Receives messaging-problem dispatches from `/cx` (root cause = messaging)
- Receives testimonials from `/cx` (via `cx-signals.json`)
- Feeds campaign data to `/analytics` (via `campaign-tracker.json`)
- Reads market sizing + positioning from `/research`

## Standalone usage examples

1. **ASO optimization:** `/marketing aso` → generates title, subtitle, keywords, description optimized for 2026 ASO best practices
2. **Email drip:** `/marketing email onboarding` → designs 3-email sequence (day 1, 3, 7) with A/B subject lines
3. **Launch kit:** `/marketing launch ai` → multi-channel kit: in-app modal, email, social posts, App Store update

## v4.0 — External Data + Learning Cache

### Integration Adapters

| Adapter | Type | What It Provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ayrshare | REST (Tier 2) | Social media publishing, scheduling, and cross-platform post management |
| app-store-connect | MCP (shared with `/cx`) | ASO metadata, keyword rankings, conversion rate data, App Store creative assets |
| firecrawl | MCP (shared with `/research`) | Competitor page scraping, ASO keyword research, content trend analysis |

**Adapter config:** `.claude/integrations/ayrshare/`, `.claude/integrations/app-store-connect/`, and `.claude/integrations/firecrawl/`

All incoming data passes through the **automatic validation gate**:

- GREEN (>= 95%): clean, auto-written
- ORANGE (90-95%): minor discrepancies, written with advisory
- RED (< 90%): blocked, user must resolve

Validation is automatic. Resolution is always manual.

### Learning Cache

**Location:** `.claude/cache/marketing/`

Caches: ASO patterns (keyword clusters, title/subtitle formulas that convert), campaign templates (UTM structures, channel mix by goal), content strategies (topic clusters, posting cadences that drove installs).

On start: check cache for matching task signature, load learned patterns.
On complete: extract new patterns, write to L1 cache. Flag cross-skill patterns for L2 promotion.
