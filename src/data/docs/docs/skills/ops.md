# `/ops` — Operations

> **Role in the ecosystem:** The infrastructure layer. Owns infrastructure health, incident response, cost tracking, and monitoring alerts. Runs continuously rather than dispatched by specific phases.

**Agent-facing prompt:** [`.claude/skills/ops/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/ops/SKILL.md)

---

## What it does

Monitors infrastructure health across all services (Railway, Supabase, CloudKit, Firebase, Vercel, GitHub Actions), manages incident response with severity classification and runbooks, tracks costs, and configures monitoring alerts.

## Sub-commands

| Command | Purpose | Standalone Example | Hub Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/ops health` | Full infrastructure check | "Is everything running?" | Continuous |
| `/ops incident {desc}` | Start incident response | "The AI engine is returning 500s" | Continuous |
| `/ops cost` | Cost report | "What are our monthly cloud costs?" | Continuous |
| `/ops alerts` | Configure monitoring | "Set up alerts for our guardrail metrics" | Continuous |

## Shared data

**Reads:** `metric-status.json` (guardrail thresholds), `health-status.json` (current status).

**Writes:** `health-status.json` (ALL fields — services, CI, quality gates, incidents, cost).

## Incident severity

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | App crashes, data loss, auth broken | Encryption failure, sync corruption |
| **P1** | Feature broken, perf degraded >50% | AI engine down, HealthKit observer stuck |
| **P2** | Feature partially broken, minor perf | Slow dashboard load, stale metrics |
| **P3** | UI glitch, minor inconsistency | Wrong icon, alignment issue |

`/ops incident` classifies automatically based on the description, generates a runbook, and creates a GitHub Issue with the correct priority label.

## PM workflow integration

`/ops` is primarily standalone/continuous — not dispatched by specific phases. Exceptions:

- **Phase 7 (Merge):** `/release` reads `/ops` health before sign-off
- **Phase 9 (Learn):** `/cx` reads infrastructure context when classifying bug reports

## Upstream / Downstream

- Reads guardrail thresholds from `/analytics` (via `metric-status.json`)
- Writes health status consumed by `/qa`, `/release`, and `/dev` (via `health-status.json`)
- Receives technical-failure dispatches from `/cx` when root cause = infra

## Standalone usage examples

1. **Health check:** `/ops health` → checks Railway, Supabase, CloudKit, Firebase, Vercel, GitHub Actions
2. **Incident response:** `/ops incident "sync failures spiking"` → classifies severity, generates runbook, creates GitHub Issue
3. **Cost planning:** `/ops cost` → projects costs at 100, 1K, 10K, 100K users

## v4.0 — External Data + Learning Cache

### Integration Adapters

| Adapter | Type | What It Provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sentry | MCP (`mcp.sentry.dev`) | Error rates, crash reporting, performance traces, release health |
| datadog | MCP (official) | Infrastructure metrics, APM traces, log aggregation, uptime monitoring |

**Adapter config:** `.claude/integrations/sentry/` and `.claude/integrations/datadog/`

All incoming data passes through the **automatic validation gate**:

- GREEN (>= 95%): clean, auto-written
- ORANGE (90-95%): minor discrepancies, written with advisory
- RED (< 90%): blocked, user must resolve

Validation is automatic. Resolution is always manual.

### Learning Cache

**Location:** `.claude/cache/ops/`

Caches: incident patterns (symptom → root cause mappings from prior incidents), threshold configs (alert tuning history per service and metric), recovery procedures (runbook steps that resolved prior P0/P1 incidents).

On start: check cache for matching task signature, load learned patterns.
On complete: extract new patterns, write to L1 cache. Flag cross-skill patterns for L2 promotion.
