# FitMe Skills Ecosystem — One-pager

> **Status: v7.7 — Validity Closure (shipped 2026-04-27).**
> Developer onboarding starts at [`docs/architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md`](../architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md) (745-line technical guide). v7.7 case study: [`docs/case-studies/framework-v7-7-validity-closure-case-study.md`](../case-studies/framework-v7-7-validity-closure-case-study.md). v7.6 case study: [`docs/case-studies/mechanical-enforcement-v7-6-case-study.md`](../case-studies/mechanical-enforcement-v7-6-case-study.md). Class B inventory (4 remain): [`docs/case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md`](../case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md). Tier 3.3 external invitation: [GitHub issue #142](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/issues/142).

**Goal:** Give every domain of the product lifecycle its own first-class skill, so product management scales past a monolithic workflow without losing the connective tissue between domains.

**Why it exists:** v1 of `/pm-workflow` did everything inline — research, PRDs, UX specs, code review, testing, deployment, docs all in one file. Adding a new domain meant bloating it; using a design audit or analytics validation meant running the whole pipeline. The ecosystem replaces that monolith with a **hub-and-spoke architecture**: 1 hub + 10 spokes + 15 shared data files + 6 local integration adapters + MCP-backed external tool integrations + 3-level learning cache + self-healing health check system. Every skill is a **Lego piece** (works alone on a single task) AND a **puzzle piece** (fits into the hub's 10-phase lifecycle).

**Where to read more:** `docs/skills/{name}.md` for deep dives on each skill. The `SKILL.md` files under `.claude/skills/{name}/` are the agent-facing prompts the harness executes; the `docs/skills/` folder is the human-facing reference.

## The 11 skills (1 hub + 10 spokes)

| # | Skill | One-liner | Sub-commands | Phase it owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | [`/pm-workflow`](pm-workflow.md) | **The hub.** Orchestrates the 10-phase lifecycle (0-9), dispatches 10 spokes, syncs external tools. | `{feature-name}` | All phases (dispatch) |

**Evolution history:**

- 2026-04-02 — ecosystem v1 shipped with 10 skills (no `/ux`)
- 2026-04-07 — `/ux` added (PR #59), split from `/design` to own the "what & why" layer. Pilot run: Onboarding v2 UX Foundations alignment pass
- 2026-04-08 — screen audit research mode (`/ux audit`), v2 refactor subtype, sub-feature queue pattern
- 2026-04-09 — v3.0: external integrations (Notion MCP, Figma MCP, Vercel), `/ux wireframe`, `/design build`, parallel subagent execution, 5 features shipped through the full lifecycle
- 2026-04-10 — v4.0: reactive data mesh, integration adapter layer (6 adapters), automatic validation gate (GREEN/ORANGE/RED), L1/L2/L3 learning cache, per-skill cache + external data source sections in all SKILL.md files
- 2026-04-10 — v4.1: Skill Internal Lifecycle (Cache Check → Research → Execute → Learn). Every skill mirrors the hub internally — 4-phase lifecycle with domain-specific research scope. Skills learn from prior executions and get faster over time.
- 2026-04-10 — v4.2: Self-healing hub. Phase 0 (Health Check) added to Skill Internal Lifecycle — 5 weighted integrity checks at random intervals verify cache staleness, hit accuracy, shared layer consistency, routing integrity, and adapter availability. Alert if score drops below 90%. L1 cache seeded from 6 completed refactors. All 11 SKILL.md files wired with cache protocol, adapters, and research scope.
- 2026-04-11 — v4.3: Operations control room + case-study monitoring + maintenance-program orchestration. The self-healing hub now has an operational layer for source-truth repair, cross-system monitoring, and showcase-ready evidence capture.
- 2026-04-13 — v4.4: Eval-Driven Development. Phase 5 (Eval) added to Skill Internal Lifecycle — 20 deterministic evals across 3 categories (formula golden I/O, AI output quality heuristics, hybrid tier behavior). ai_quality_metrics block added to case study monitoring. Every feature now produces eval definitions during Phase 2 (Tasks) and runs them during Phase 5 (Test). The framework learns from eval failures via anti-pattern cache promotion.
- 2026-04-14 — v5.0: SoC-on-Software chip architecture principles. Skill-on-demand loading (~30K tokens saved) via phase_skills routing. Cache compression via compressed_view (~24K tokens saved). Combined: ~54K tokens reclaimed (27% of context window).
- 2026-04-14 — v5.1: Complete SoC-on-Software suite (8/8 items). Adds model tiering (sonnet/opus per phase), batch dispatch (template-once iterate-N), result forwarding (inline skill output), speculative cache pre-loading (successor map), systolic chain protocol (isolated pipelines), and task complexity gate (big.LITTLE parallel/serial lanes). Combined: 63% framework overhead reduction (121K → 45K tokens per phase). Savings report: `docs/architecture/soc-savings-report-v5.1.md`.
- 2026-04-16 — v5.2 Sub-Project A: Dispatch Intelligence. 3-stage pipeline (score complexity → probe capability → dispatch with budget). Static complexity scoring with validation flag. Tool budgets (haiku=10, sonnet=25, opus=50) cut average tool usage by 48% and variance by 84%. Permission table hard-routes .claude/ paths to controller. Config: `.claude/shared/dispatch-intelligence.json`.
- 2026-04-16 — v5.2 Sub-Project B: Parallel Write Safety. 2-layer system: snapshot/rollback + code region mirror pattern. 3-tier region detection (agent-region markers → MARK sections → full file). Progressive marker learning — system gets faster with every dispatch. Config: `dispatch-intelligence.json` mirror_pattern section.
- 2026-04-16 — v6.0: Framework Measurement. Deterministic phase timing (measured wall time, not estimated), L1/L2/L3 cache hit tracking (cache-hits.json), eval coverage gates, monitoring auto-sync, token counting (79K tokens measured), CU v2 continuous factors, rolling baselines, serial/parallel velocity decomposition.

## The 15 shared data files

Located under `.claude/shared/`:

| File | Purpose | Primary owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context.json` | Product identity, personas, brand, guardrails | `/pm-workflow` + `/research` |
| `feature-registry.json` | All 16 features with status + metrics + pain points | `/pm-workflow` |
| `framework-health.json` | Health-check config, weighted integrity rules, and check history | `/pm-workflow` |
| `framework-manifest.json` | Canonical framework version, counts, source-of-truth metadata, and active capabilities | `/pm-workflow` |
| `external-sync-status.json` | Live Notion + Linear sync snapshot for dashboard truth checks and maintenance work | `/pm-workflow` + `/ops` |
| `metric-status.json` | 40 metrics with targets + instrumentation status | `/analytics` |

## External integrations

### Existing (v3.0)

| Integration | Protocol | Direction | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | `gh` CLI | Bidirectional | Issue labels, PR management, CI status, milestone tracking |
| **Notion MCP** | Model Context Protocol | Bidirectional | Project board sync — phase transitions push status updates automatically |
| **Figma MCP** | Model Context Protocol | Read + Write | Design context retrieval, screenshot capture, code connect, design-to-code builds |
| **Vercel** | Deploy preview | Read | Preview URLs attached to PRs for visual review |

### New (v4.0) — Integration Adapters

Each adapter lives in `.claude/integrations/{service}/` with `adapter.md` + `schema.json` + `mapping.json`. All data passes through the **automatic validation gate** before entering the shared layer.

| Adapter | MCP Package | Consuming Skills | Shared Layer Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GA4** | `mcp-server-ga4` | /analytics, /pm-workflow, /cx | metric-status.json |
| **App Store Connect** | `asc-mcp` (208 tools) | /cx, /release, /marketing | cx-signals.json, feature-registry.json |
| **Sentry** | `mcp.sentry.dev` | /ops, /cx, /qa | health-status.json, cx-signals.json |
| **Firecrawl** | `firecrawl-mcp` | /research, /marketing | context.json, feature-registry.json |
| **Axe** | `@anthropic-ai/mcp-axe` | /ux, /qa, /design | design-system.json, test-coverage.json |
| **Security Audit** | `mcp-security-audit` | /dev, /ops, /qa | health-status.json, test-coverage.json |

### Validation Gate

All incoming external data is automatically cross-referenced against existing shared layer state:

- **GREEN (>= 95%)** — Data is clean. Write + notify receiving skill and hub.
- **ORANGE (90-95%)** — Minor discrepancies. Write + advisory. Review when convenient.
- **RED (< 90%)** — Significant contradictions. DO NOT write. User must resolve.

Validation is automatic. Resolution is always manual.

## Learning Cache

Located under `.claude/cache/`:

| Level | Location | Scope | Promotion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | `.claude/cache/{skill}/` | Per-skill patterns and decisions | Default home |
| **L2** | `.claude/cache/_shared/` | Cross-skill patterns (2+ skills share) | Promoted from L1 |
| **L3** | `.claude/cache/_project/` | Project-wide architectural conventions | Promoted from L2 (5+ skills) |

Cache entries store: task signatures, learned patterns, anti-patterns, and speedup instructions. Staleness is tracked via SHA256 hashes of source files. Demonstrated ~65% speedup by 4th similar task (e.g., applying UX foundations across screens).

## What's been built (as of 2026-04-10)

**8 features shipped through the full PM lifecycle (all 6 screens v2 aligned):**

| Feature | PR | Type | Key artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home Today Screen v2 | #61 | Feature (v2_refactor) | 27-finding audit, v2/ convention at scale |
| Onboarding retro | #63 | Enhancement | Retroactive v2 alignment of pilot feature |
| Body Composition card | #65 | Enhancement | Reusable metric tile drill-down pattern |
| Metric Deep Link | #67 | Enhancement | Home tile → detail view deep navigation |
| Training Plan v2 | #74 | Feature (v2_refactor) | 533-line container + 6 extracted views, 12 events, 16 tests |
| Nutrition v2 | #75 | Feature (v2_refactor) | ProgressBar component, AppOpacity enum, 5 events, 7 tests |
| Stats v2 | #76 | Feature (v2_refactor) | AppLayout enum, chart a11y, 4 events, 6 tests |
| Settings v2 | #77 | Feature (v2_refactor) | Color tokenization, destructive action a11y, 3 events, 5 tests |

**Ecosystem capabilities validated:**

- **All 6 main screens v2 aligned** — Onboarding, Home, Training, Nutrition, Stats, Settings all pass UX Foundations
- **119 audit findings** fixed across 6 screens (from v2-audit-report.md)
- **33 screen-prefixed analytics events** instrumented (`home_*`, `training_*`, `nutrition_*`, `stats_*`, `settings_*`, `onboarding_*`)
- **60+ analytics tests** across 6 test files validating instrumentation
- **Screen audit workflow** — `/ux audit` produces `v2-audit-report.md` with numbered findings + decisions log before code
- **Sub-feature queue** — parent audit (Home v2) spawned 4 child features, each tracked independently
- **Parallel subagent execution** — independent tasks dispatched to multiple skills simultaneously, converging at review gates
- **Learning cache validated** — Nutrition v2 (4th refactor) completed research→implementation in ~2h vs Home v2 (1st) at ~36h
- **v4.2 Self-healing lifecycle** — Health Check → Cache Check → Research → Execute → Learn validated across the wired skill set
- **v4.3 Operational layer** — control room workflow, case-study monitoring, and maintenance-program framing now sit on top of the self-healing hub

    SHARED DATA LAYER (.claude/shared/*.json)

    context.json · feature-registry.json · framework-health.json
    framework-manifest.json · external-sync-status.json
    metric-status.json · design-system.json · test-coverage.json
    cx-signals.json · campaign-tracker.json · health-status.json

**Key connections:**

- **`/ux` → `/design`** — `ux-spec.md` is the handoff. `/ux` owns what and why; `/design` owns how it looks.
- **`/research` → `/ux`** — competitive UX patterns and HIG references flow from research into UX planning.
- **`/design` → `/dev`** — token pipeline (`design-system.json`) is the contract between designed components and coded components.
- **`/analytics` → `/qa`** — analytics tests go in the same test suite as functional tests; one CI gate validates both.
- **`/cx` → back to `/pm-workflow`** — post-deployment feedback closes the loop. Root cause classification (messaging / UX / functionality / expectation) dispatches a new work item to the appropriate skill.

## Where each skill sits in the PM workflow

```text
Phase 0  Research  ─────▶ /research (new feat) OR /ux audit (v2 refactor / screen scope) · /cx (pain points)
Phase 1  PRD       ─────▶ /analytics spec (instrumentation plan)
Phase 2  Tasks     ─────▶ /pm-workflow (internal — no dispatch)
Phase 3  UX/Integ  ─────▶ /ux research → /ux spec → /ux validate → /design audit
Phase 4  Implement ─────▶ /dev branch · parallel task dispatch to {skill}
Phase 5  Test      ─────▶ /qa plan · /qa run · /analytics validate · /ux validate
Phase 6  Review    ─────▶ /dev review · /design audit · /ux validate
Phase 7  Merge     ─────▶ /release checklist · /analytics regression
Phase 8  Docs      ─────▶ /marketing launch · /analytics dashboard
Phase 9  Learn     ─────▶ /cx analyze · /analytics report · root cause dispatch
```

The hub never does inline work — it reads state, decides which skill to dispatch, and waits for the user to approve each phase transition.

---

## Rules that apply to every skill

1. **Every skill is standalone.** You can invoke any skill directly (`/design audit`, `/qa run`, `/cx analyze`) without running a full PM workflow.
2. **Every skill is composable.** The hub can chain skills together for a full lifecycle.
3. **Every skill has clear boundaries.** Docs describe what it does AND what it doesn't.
4. **Every skill writes to at most one shared file.** Reads from many.
5. **No skill auto-advances.** User approves every phase transition.
6. **Change broadcasts.** When a work item completes, `/pm-workflow` writes to `change-log.json` and notifies downstream skills so the system stays aware.
7. **Every skill follows the 5-phase internal lifecycle.** Health Check → Cache Check → Research (if miss) → Execute → Learn. Skills mirror the hub structure internally.
8. **Every skill declares its external data sources.** Local adapters, external connectors, shared layer targets, and validation gate behavior are documented in each SKILL.md.
9. **Every skill has a domain-specific research scope.** 5 research dimensions + source priority order. When cache misses, the skill knows exactly what to investigate.
10. **Data flows reactively.** Any entry point, any time. A single skill invocation can ripple through the entire shared layer.
11. **Every skill runs Phase 0 (Health Check) on random trigger.** ~25% probability with 2h cooldown. 5 weighted checks verify cache, shared layer, routing, and adapter integrity. If score < 90%, execution halts until resolved.
12. **Every feature defines eval cases.** During Phase 2 (Tasks), define golden input/output cases and quality heuristics. During Phase 5 (Test), run evals alongside unit tests. Eval results are recorded in case-study-monitoring.json and failed evals become anti-patterns in the L1 cache.
