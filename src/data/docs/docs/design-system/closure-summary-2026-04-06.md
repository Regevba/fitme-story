# Design System Closure Summary — 2026-04-06

> **Status:** ALL SPRINTS COMPLETE ✅
> **Outcome:** Design system closed and ready to support new UI/UX work
> **Audit reference:** `docs/design-system/closure-audit-2026-04-06.md`

## Executive Summary

The design system underwent a 4-sprint closure cycle on 2026-04-06 to eliminate technical debt and add the missing UX foundation layer before resuming UI/UX feature work.

**Total work:** 4 sprints, ~3,000 lines of new content + token cleanup, all committed and pushed.

| Sprint | Goal | Outcome |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Sprint A** | Eliminate raw token literals | 41 raw fonts + 9 raw spacings → 0 (14 files modified) |
| **Sprint UX** | Add UX foundation layer | Created `ux-foundations.md` (1,533 lines, 10 parts) + `/ux` skill (217 lines) |
| **Sprint B** | Accessibility coverage | 17 a11y labels added + 6 #Preview blocks |
| **Sprint C** | Documentation alignment | Notion + PRD + README standardized to 125 tokens |

---

## Sprint A: Token Literal Cleanup

**Problem:** 41 raw font literals + 9 raw spacing literals across 14 files violated the "no raw values in views" contract.

**Solution:**
1. Added 5 new icon AppText tokens to `AppTheme.swift`: `iconSmall` (18pt), `iconMedium` (28pt), `iconLarge` (48pt), `iconHero` (64pt), `iconDisplay` (72pt)
2. Migrated all 41 raw font literals to AppText tokens
3. Migrated 9 raw spacing literals to AppSpacing tokens
4. Documented 12 intentional exceptions (responsive fonts in MainScreenView, proportional fonts in FitMeLogoLoader/FitMeBrandIcon)

**Files modified (14):**
- `FitTracker/Services/AppTheme.swift` (+8 lines: new icon tokens)
- `FitTracker/DesignSystem/AppComponents.swift`
- `FitTracker/Services/AuthManager.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Auth/AccountPanelView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/ConsentView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Main/MainScreenView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Nutrition/MealEntrySheet.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Nutrition/NutritionView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingConsentView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingFirstActionView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingGoalsView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingHealthKitView.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Shared/ReadinessCard.swift`
- `FitTracker/Views/Training/TrainingPlanView.swift` (17 fixes — biggest offender)

**Result:** Zero raw `.font(.headline)`, `.font(.title2)`, `.font(.title3)`, `.font(.body)` in production code. All exceptions documented inline.

**Commit:** `8b16774`

## Sprint UX: UX Foundation Layer

**Problem:** The PM workflow defined 8 UX principles as bullet points, but only 2 of 16 features had ever completed a formal UX spec. Zero `ux-research.md` files existed. The UX framework was 4 days old and aspirational, not a living operating model.

**Solution:**

### 1. Created `/ux` skill
**File:** `.claude/skills/ux/SKILL.md` (217 lines)

5 sub-commands:
- `/ux research {feature}` — UX research against 13 principles + HIG + competitive analysis
- `/ux spec {feature}` — Full UX specification with flows, states, accessibility
- `/ux validate {feature}` — Heuristic evaluation + principle compliance check
- `/ux audit` — App-wide UX audit
- `/ux patterns` — Quick reference to UX pattern library

13 UX principles documented:
- 8 core: Fitts's, Hick's, Jakob's, Progressive Disclosure, Recognition over Recall, Consistency, Feedback, Error Prevention
- 5 FitMe-specific: Readiness-First, Zero-Friction Logging, Privacy by Default, Progressive Profiling, Celebration Not Guilt

Boundary defined vs `/design` skill:
- `/ux` owns the **what and why** (flows, behavior, heuristics, usability)
- `/design` owns the **how it looks** (tokens, components, Figma, compliance)

### 2. Created `ux-foundations.md`
**File:** `docs/design-system/ux-foundations.md` (1,533 lines, 10 parts)

The grounding reference for every UI decision in FitMe:

| Part | Title | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Design Philosophy & Principles | 8 core + 5 FitMe-specific principles with definitions, examples, do/don't |
| 2 | Information Architecture | Today vs History axis, 4-tab structure, content hierarchy, depth limits |
| 3 | Interaction Patterns | Navigation, input, feedback (haptic taxonomy), gesture patterns |
| 4 | Data Visualization | Chart types, metric hierarchy, color semantics, accessibility |
| 5 | Permission & Trust | 3-step priming pattern, FitMe permission matrix, trust signals, GDPR |
| 6 | State Patterns | Loading, empty, error, success — with thresholds and copy formulas |
| 7 | Accessibility Standards | Visual, motor, cognitive, screen reader (VoiceOver) |
| 8 | Micro-Interactions & Motion | Animation principles, haptic patterns, Reduce Motion compliance |
| 9 | Content Strategy | Tone, terminology glossary, number formatting, health sensitivity |
| 10 | Platform-Specific Patterns | iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, macOS, Android |

### 3. Updated PM Workflow
**File:** `docs/project/pm-hub-evolution.md` Section 14 added

Phase 3 choreography:
```
/ux research → /ux spec → /ux validate → /design audit → User approval → Implementation
```

**Why segmented approach worked:** Wrote in 6 commits, one per segment. Previous monolithic agent attempts failed due to plan mode blocks, timeouts, and rate limits. Segmented + checkpointed approach succeeded.

**Commits:** `4876cb7` (Part 1) → `9d7c7bb` (Part 2) → `4880ef2` (verification fix) → `3a2ebd8` (Parts 3-4) → `dc77d80` (Parts 5-6) → `2fe90ca` (Parts 7-8) → `f59faa5` (Parts 9-10 + sources) → `1ba198a` (/ux skill + hub update)

---

## Sprint B: Accessibility Pass

**Problem:** Closure audit estimated 150+ accessibility labels needed.

**Reality check:** Most buttons already had implicit labels via SwiftUI's `Label("Text", systemImage:)` or `Button("Text") {}` patterns. Only icon-only and custom-view buttons needed manual `accessibilityLabel`.

**Solution:**

### Accessibility Labels (17 added)

| File | Labels Added |
|------|--------------|
| TrainingPlanView | 6 (rest timer, exercise focus, photo controls, RPE selector, stepper) |
| NutritionView | 6 (chevrons, info buttons, expand toggles) |
| SettingsView | 1 (selection grid tile) |
| StatsView | 1 (metric selection card) |
| MainScreenView | 2 (manual entry, primary action) |
| MealEntrySheet | 1 (picker label improvement) |

### Component Previews (6 added)

| File | Previews Added |
|------|----------------|
| AppComponents.swift | 5 (AppPickerChip, AppFilterBar, AppSegmentedControl, AppProgressRing, AppStatRow) |
| ReadinessCard.swift | 1 (with environment object injection) |

`AppDesignSystemComponents.swift` already had a comprehensive `PreviewProvider` covering 8 components.

**Commits:** `531bb81` (labels), `b27afbf` (AppComponents previews), `be82301` (ReadinessCard preview)

---

## Sprint C: Documentation Alignment

**Problem:** Token count was reported as 92, ~120, and 125 across different docs. Notion was stale since 2026-04-02 (didn't reflect GDPR shipping, GA4 shipping, onboarding implementation, parallel task hub).

**Solution:**

### Notion Updates
1. **"10. Design System v2"** page — corrected token count (92→125), added Sprint A/B/UX/C status, fixed `make lint-ds` reference (it's `make tokens-check`)
2. **"Project Context & Status"** page — updated shipped deliverables list (10→20), moved GDPR/Onboarding/Design System closure from "Critical Gaps" to "Recently Resolved"

### PRD 18.10 Update
**File:** `docs/product/prd/18.10-design-system.md`
- Token count: ~120 → **125** (verified)
- Updated typography count: 20+ → 22 (with 5 new icon tokens listed)
- Added Closure Sprint History section
- Added Resolved Gaps table
- Updated Success Metrics with current values (all green)
- Added References section linking to closure docs

### README Update
**File:** `README.md`
- Two locations updated: ~120 → 125 tokens
- Added reference to `ux-foundations.md`

---

## Verification

### Token Pipeline
- ✅ `make tokens-check` passes
- ✅ Zero raw `.font(.headline)`, `.font(.title2)`, `.font(.title3)`, `.font(.body)` in production
- ✅ Zero raw `.padding(N)` off the 4pt grid (except documented exceptions)

### Documentation Consistency
- ✅ CLAUDE.md: 125 tokens
- ✅ README: 125 tokens (2 locations)
- ✅ design-system.json: 125 tokens
- ✅ PRD 18.10: 125 tokens
- ✅ Notion DS v2 page: 125 tokens
- ✅ Notion Project Context: shipped status reflects reality

### New Capabilities
- ✅ `/ux` skill available in PM hub (5 sub-commands)
- ✅ `ux-foundations.md` exists and is referenced from skill + PRD + README
- ✅ All 13+ design system components have #Preview blocks
- ✅ All icon-only buttons have accessibilityLabel

## What's Next

The design system is closed and ready to support new UI/UX work. The remaining roadmap:

1. **Onboarding feature** — currently in testing phase, ready for review → merge
2. **Figma onboarding v2 screens** — prompt at `docs/project/figma-onboarding-v2-prompt.md` ready for Claude Console
3. **Product gap closure** — food DB integration, barcode scanning, Google Sign-In, readiness score formula
4. **Phase 2 completion** — Skills OS (RICE 3.2) + CX System (RICE 3.2)
5. **Phase 3** — Android app research (RICE 3.6) + Health APIs (RICE 2.1)

All future UI/UX work must:
- Reference `docs/design-system/ux-foundations.md` for patterns
- Use `/ux research` and `/ux spec` before visual design
- Pass `/ux validate` before merge
- Pass `/design audit` for compliance
- Maintain 100% token compliance (no raw literals)
