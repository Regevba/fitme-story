# FitMe Master Plan — 2026-04-06 (SSD Home Edition)

> **Date:** 2026-04-06
> **Purpose:** Reconciled master plan after full codebase review, SSD migration, and PM workflow audit. Supersedes `master-plan-reconciled-2026-04-05.md`.
> **Context:** Project moved from local internal storage to external SSD. New agent taking ownership. All prior work verified via git history.

## Executive Summary

FitMe is a production-grade iOS fitness app with 11 shipped core features, zero-knowledge encryption, GDPR compliance, GA4 analytics, and a federated AI layer. The codebase scores **A-** on code quality. The project has a mature PM workflow, 20 feature PRDs, 55 passing tests, and comprehensive documentation.

**The SSD is now the canonical home.** All development, builds, and verification happen from this location. The repo is fully portable — no hardcoded local paths in source code.

### What Was Inherited (Previous Agent Work)
- 26 commits after main branch (119 files, +17,160 lines)
- 3 features shipped through full PM lifecycle (GA4, GDPR, Android DS)
- Marketing website, skills ecosystem, 20 PRDs created
- Major stabilization pass: build repair, auth fixes, sync fixes, 40 XCTests
- `make verify-local` created as one-command full verification

### What This Session Built
- **6 force unwraps eliminated** from production Swift code (P0)
- **Stale path references cleaned**, xcuserdata removed, .gitignore fixed
- **PM compliance raised from 71% to ~95%** — 16/16 features now have state.json with metrics
- **Parallel Task Hub** — work item types (Feature/Enhancement/Fix/Chore), structured tasks in state.json, skill-based routing, dependency-aware parallel dispatch
- **Cross-feature priority queue** with scoring (fixes auto-jump the queue)
- **Change broadcast protocol** — every merge notifies all skills, feedback loop closes through /cx
- **Dashboard Tasks view** — TaskBoard (skill swim lanes), TaskCard, DependencyGraph (SVG DAG), 21 parser tests
- **SSD storage redirect** — all build artifacts to `.build/` on `/Volumes/DevSSD`
- **Full documentation** — `docs/project/pm-hub-evolution.md`

### Framework Evolution (Post-Session Updates)

- **v3.0** (2026-04-09) — External integrations (Notion, Figma MCP), parallel subagent execution
- **v4.0** (2026-04-10) — Reactive data mesh, integration adapters, validation gate, L1/L2/L3 learning cache
- **v4.1** (2026-04-10) — Skill Internal Lifecycle (Cache → Research → Execute → Learn)
- **v4.2** (2026-04-10) — Self-healing hub, Phase 0 health checks, cache seeding
- **v4.3** (2026-04-11) — Operations control room, case-study monitoring
- **v4.4** (2026-04-13) — Eval-driven development, ai_quality_metrics
- **v5.0** (2026-04-14) — SoC-on-Software: skill-on-demand + cache compression (54K tokens reclaimed)
- **v5.1** (2026-04-14) — Complete SoC suite (8/8 items): model tiering, batch dispatch, result forwarding, speculative preloading, systolic chains, task complexity gate
- **v5.2** (2026-04-16) — Dispatch Intelligence (3-stage pipeline, tool budgets, complexity scoring) + Parallel Write Safety (snapshot/rollback, 3-tier mirror extraction, progressive markers)
- **v6.0** (2026-04-16) — Framework Measurement: deterministic phase timing, cache hit tracking, eval gates, CU v2, rolling baselines

**Current framework version: v6.0.** Full evolution history: `docs/skills/evolution.md`

| Full Verification | Green | `make verify-local` |

### Runtime Verification Still Blocked
- Firebase analytics: needs local `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Supabase sync: needs real credentials in `Info.plist`
- Signed-in deletion/export: needs backend access
- Simulator ID: may need update for new machine (`SIMULATOR_ID=...` override)

## SSD Environment Notes

All build artifacts stay on the SSD in `.build/` alongside the source:

```makefile
PROJECT_ROOT := $(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))))
BUILD_DIR    ?= $(PROJECT_ROOT).build     # Everything here
AI_VENV      ?= $(BUILD_DIR)/ai-venv
SPM_CACHE    ?= $(BUILD_DIR)/spm-cache
DERIVED_DATA ?= $(BUILD_DIR)/DerivedData
```

After SSD clone/move, run:
```bash
npm install                    # Root (token pipeline)
cd dashboard && npm install    # Dashboard
cd website && npm install      # Marketing site
cd ai-engine && python3.12 -m venv .build/ai-venv && source .build/ai-venv/bin/activate && pip install -e '.[dev]'
make verify-local              # Full verification — all output to .build/
```

One-time Mac setup (optional):
```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDECustomDerivedDataLocation "/Volumes/DevSSD/FitTracker2/.build/DerivedData"
```
