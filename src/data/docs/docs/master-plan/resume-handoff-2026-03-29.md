# FitTracker Resume Handoff

Last updated: 2026-03-29  
Primary branch: `codex/ui-integration`  
Current branch checkpoint: `77e9510`  
Primary Figma file: [FitTracker Design System Library](https://www.figma.com/design/0Ai7s3fCFqR5JXDW8JvgmD)

This file is the fastest way to resume work from the current point without relying on chat history.

## 1. Where the project is now

The project has moved from separate UI redesign branches into one integrated Apple-first baseline on `codex/ui-integration`.

The approved Apple-first screens are:
- Login
- Home
- Training
- Nutrition
- Stats
- grouped Settings

The repo now also contains:
- a semantic design-system foundation in code
- shared UI primitives
- synchronized Figma live assets for approved screens
- design-system governance, review, and progress docs
- a presentation-ready README
- a project walkthrough, changelog, and merge-package draft

## 2. Important source-of-truth locations

### Code
- App UI integration branch: `.worktrees/ui-integration`
- Design-system tokens: [AppTheme.swift](FitTracker/Services/AppTheme.swift)
- Shared UI primitives: [AppDesignSystemComponents.swift](FitTracker/Views/Shared/AppDesignSystemComponents.swift)

### Documentation
- Main project entrypoint: [README.md](README.md)
- Full project story: [fittracker-evolution-walkthrough.md](docs/project/fittracker-evolution-walkthrough.md)
- Milestone history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Merge brief: [ui-integration-pr-draft.md](docs/project/ui-integration-pr-draft.md)
- Design-system memory: [feature-memory.md](docs/design-system/feature-memory.md)
- Figma progress: [figma-library-progress.md](docs/design-system/figma-library-progress.md)
- Phase gate: [integration-phase-acceptance-checklist.md](docs/design-system/integration-phase-acceptance-checklist.md)

### Figma
- File key: `0Ai7s3fCFqR5JXDW8JvgmD`
- The file contains:
  - `Foundations`
  - `Components`
  - `Patterns`
  - approved product-area pages
  - integrated runtime boards
  - design-system guidance
  - `Prototype / iPhone App`
  - `Prototype / Flow Map`
- The live iPhone prototype now exists in the same file and is built from approved integrated runtime boards rather than screenshots.

## 3. What was completed

### Product and UI
- approved screen baselines were refined and locked screen by screen
- approved screens were merged into `codex/ui-integration`
- Home and Training were aligned to the cooler blue Apple-first shell
- Nutrition and Stats were aligned to the same product direction
- grouped Settings architecture was restored as the correct source of truth

### Design system
- semantic color, spacing, type, radius, shadow, and gradient roles were established
- shared UI primitives were introduced and expanded
- `Foundations` became the primary guidance layer in Figma
- color guidance was completed with exact hex and RGBA values

### Review and synchronization
- integrated simulator review mode was added
- Figma boards were standardized with runtime metadata and QA structure
- approved screen pages now contain editable integrated runtime boards
- the first live Figma prototype layer now exists with clickable main-flow navigation
- representative grouped Settings detail prototype screens now exist and are wired into the prototype
- README and docs were rewritten so the repo can also function as a readable presentation project

## 4. What is still not fully closed

The Apple-first phase is close, but not fully closed yet.

Remaining work:
- complete final integrated runtime proof at the same standard for every approved screen
- expand and polish the live iPhone prototype in Figma
- add more auth and populated-state variants to the prototype
- update docs and PR brief again once the prototype reaches final closure quality
- complete the final merge handoff into `main`

Most important open blocker:
- `Settings` still needs cleaner direct integrated runtime proof because the simulator review route has been inconsistent

## 5. Git and PR state

### Branches
- current working branch: `codex/ui-integration`
- target merge branch: `main`

### Push state
- latest confirmed pushed prototype checkpoint before this doc refresh is `77e9510`
- this handoff should be pushed again after the current documentation checkpoint is committed

### PR state
- a full local PR draft exists here: [ui-integration-pr-draft.md](docs/project/ui-integration-pr-draft.md)
- actual remote PR creation is still blocked

Current GitHub access issue:
- `gh auth status` reports invalid auth
- GitHub app PR creation returned `404 Not Found` for the repo

To resume remote PR work later:
1. re-authenticate GitHub CLI with `gh auth login -h github.com`
2. verify repo access
3. create or update the draft PR from `codex/ui-integration` into `main`

## 6. Suggested next steps

Resume in this order:

1. Expand the live iPhone prototype in the existing Figma file with more auth and populated-state variants.
2. Re-run unified integrated runtime checks, especially for `Settings`.
3. Refresh the README, walkthrough, changelog, and PR draft one more time after prototype closure.
4. Restore GitHub access and open the real draft PR remotely.
5. Run final merge verification before merging `codex/ui-integration` into `main`.

## 7. Resume prompt

Use this prompt in a future session:

> Resume FitTracker from `.worktrees/ui-integration` on branch `codex/ui-integration`. Use `docs/project/resume-handoff-2026-03-29.md`, `docs/design-system/feature-memory.md`, `docs/design-system/figma-library-progress.md`, and the Figma file `0Ai7s3fCFqR5JXDW8JvgmD` as the source of truth. Prototype v1 already exists in Figma with main-flow interactions and grouped Settings detail states. The next priorities are prototype expansion and polish, final integrated runtime proof, Settings runtime verification, and preparing the remote draft PR into `main`.
