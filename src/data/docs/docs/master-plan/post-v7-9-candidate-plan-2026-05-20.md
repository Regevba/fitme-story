# Post-v7.9 Candidate Plan — Drafted 2026-05-20 (Eve of Promotion)

> **Status:** DRAFT · saved for tomorrow's resume after v7.9 promotion decision lands
> **Drafted:** 2026-05-20 (operator + Claude session)
> **First action tomorrow:** master plan + backlog + sub-plan refresh BEFORE any feature work
> **Resume from:** read this doc top-to-bottom, then proceed in the order below

## 0. CRITICAL PRIORITY ORDER (per operator direction 2026-05-20)

**Before any chore / task / enhancement / feature is advanced, complete the following refresh:**

1. **Master plan §1 / §3.6 / §5 / §10** — `docs/master-plan/infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`
2. **Backlog "Done (Shipped)" + "In Progress"** — `docs/product/backlog.md` (~30 entries missing since 2026-04-09; 6 weeks of drift)
3. **Sub-plan refresh** — every spec/plan referenced in this doc must be reviewed for staleness; explicit list in §6 below
4. **MEMORY.md "Latest" entry fix** — D1 drift correction (says #411 OPEN; it's MERGED)
5. **New cold-start entrypoint** — `.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md` (per master plan §2.3 side-effects)

Estimated effort for prerequisite refresh: **~4-5 hours focused work**.

**Do NOT start any work below until §0 lands.**

## 1. v7.9 Promotion Side-Effects (TOMORROW's freeze-day work)

Per infra-master-plan §2.3 — these MUST ship as part of (or immediately after) the v7.9 promotion PR:

| # | Action | File | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Drop 2 enforced gate IDs from CLAUDE.md "Known Mechanical Limits" advisory list | `CLAUDE.md` | 10 min |
| C-2 | Flip `BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = False` in `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | `scripts/check-state-schema.py` | 5 min |
| C-3 | Create cold-start entrypoint `framework-v7-9.md` | `.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md` (new) | 20 min |
