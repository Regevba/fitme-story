# Post-v7.9 Candidate Plan — Drafted 2026-05-20 (Eve of Promotion)

> **Item-tracking convention (FIT-200, est. 2026-06-29):** items here are tracked under the
> [cross-layer naming convention](../process/cross-layer-item-naming-convention.md) — **slug** (canonical) + **`FIT-NNN`**
> (`state.json.linear_id`) + **scheme-prefixed code**: this plan uses `FW-` (framework candidates).
> Status vocabulary (all layers): **Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Blocked → Done → Won't-Do**.
> Live per-item status: [`.claude/shared/item-registry.json`](../../.claude/shared/item-registry.json)
> (`make crosswalk`) + the Linear "Fitme project" board. Repo (`state.json.current_phase`) is
> the source of truth; this doc is a planning view. Bare thematic codes (`F4`/`T14`/`R14`) are
> retired in favor of prefixed codes to prevent the cross-scheme collisions reconciled 2026-06-29.

> **Status:** ✅ LARGELY EXECUTED (refreshed 2026-06-07) · v7.9 promoted 2026-05-21, Phase E exited cleanly 2026-06-04, v7.9.1 build window shipped 2026-06-04. Most E-series candidates here have shipped — notably **E-14 F-LAUNCHD-DRIFT-EXTENSION** (all 3 sub-fixes, v7.9.1 #621–#624). Current forward reality lives in the [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) 2026-06-07 status banner; remaining infra tails + the calibration ladder (F16 06-18 / W9 ~06-28 [reset from 06-20 by the 06-14 session-id-keying fix] / t14 06-21 → v7.10) are tracked there + in [`.claude/shared/v7-9-1-candidates.md`](../../.claude/shared/v7-9-1-candidates.md).
> **Drafted:** 2026-05-20 (operator + Claude session)
> **Resume from:** historical — read the infra-master-plan banner first for current reality, then this doc for the original candidate detail.

## 0. CRITICAL PRIORITY ORDER (per operator direction 2026-05-20)

**Before any chore / task / enhancement / feature is advanced, complete the following refresh:**

1. **Master plan §1 / §3.6 / §5 / §10** — `docs/master-plan/infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`
2. **Backlog "Done (Shipped)" + "In Progress"** — `docs/product/backlog.md` (~30 entries missing since 2026-04-09; 6 weeks of drift)
3. **Sub-plan refresh** — every spec/plan referenced in this doc must be reviewed for staleness; explicit list in §6 below
4. **MEMORY.md "Latest" entry fix** — D1 drift correction (says #411 OPEN; it's MERGED)
5. **New cold-start entrypoint** — `.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md` (per master plan §2.3 side-effects)

Estimated effort for prerequisite refresh: **~4-5 hours focused work**.

**Do NOT start any work below until §0 lands.**

Bayesian per-user posterior + Supabase server-cohort prior cannot calibrate against operator-only TestFlight traffic. Same disposition class as **D-2** (GA4 conversions config re-deferred today to `app_store_launch`): zero meaningful signal in pre-launch traffic = vanity numbers, not measurement.
