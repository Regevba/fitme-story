## §1 TL;DR

A 3-phase, 4-window analytics framework upgrade that closes 56-row CSV drift + 4 unfired iOS events + 21 untested events + disconnected GA4 MCP + 2 unwired web events, then adds a live event debugger and operator dashboards. Phase 1.A (hygiene) + Phase 2 (debugger) ship next week as non-gate work; Phase 3 (dashboards) ships during v7.9 Phase E; Phase 1.B (gates) ships via 22-day Calibration Protocol post-Phase-E.

| Phase | Window | Effort | Gate-additive? | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.A Hygiene | 2026-05-15 → 22 | 6h | No | Backfill + wire + test |
| 2 Live debugger | 2026-05-15 → 22 (parallel 1.A) | 8h | No | Local mirror + `/analytics watch` + GA4 Realtime poll |
| 3 Dashboards | 2026-05-21 → 06-04 (parallel v7.9 Phase E) | 10h | No | `/control-room/analytics` + Looker template |
| 1.B Gates | 2026-06-04 → 06-26 | 6h | **Yes** (2 new) | `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` + `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` |

**Total effort:** ~30 hours over 6 weeks. **Total ship:** 2026-06-26.

## §2 Background & Motivation

[Audit findings preserved in companion decisions-log §2.](analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md#2-audit-findings-the-empirical-baseline). Headlines:

- iOS: **114 events declared**, only 58 in CSV (**56 missing rows**); 4 events declared but never fired; 21 events untested.
- Web (fitme-story): 12/14 events wired (2 declared but unwired); no `.env.example` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`.
- GA4 MCP: **defined but disconnected** — cannot mechanically verify firing.
- Existing `/analytics validate` skill knew how to detect taxonomy drift but only ran as a manual sub-command, not a gate.

**Trigger event:** Operator audit 2026-05-13 surfaced the drift. Without a gate, drift accumulates every time a new feature adds events. Phase 1.B exists to prevent recurrence.

---

## §3 Approach

**Approach B (phased single feature)** — one feature, one Linear epic, one Notion page, three sequential phases each merging independently. Rejected alternatives:

- **Approach A (monolithic)** — one big-bang PR. ✗ Long time-to-value, hard to review.
- **Approach C (three separate features)** — 3× PM-workflow ceremony for one workstream. ✗ Excessive overhead.

```

**Key design constraints:**

- Local mirror is **off by default**; activates only when `DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1` (iOS scheme env var) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1` (web). No production overhead, no PII risk.
- The mirror is a **passive duplicate** — events still go to Firebase/GA4 as today.
- Phase 1.B gates ship **advisory first**, walk 22-day A → B → C → D → E protocol before enforcement.
- `/control-room/analytics` reuses existing UCC passkey auth (`ucc-passkey-auth` shipped 2026-05-07).
- Looker Studio template is an operator-imported JSON; no runtime infra cost.

## §5 Phase 1.A — Hygiene (window 2026-05-15 → 22, ~6h, non-gate)

### §5.1 Tasks

| ID | Task | Effort | Owner | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.A.1 | ~~Backfill 56 missing CSV rows from iOS enum~~ **DONE** 2026-05-13 (PR #334) — flat-scan picked up all 49 events + 7 screens + 1 user prop in a single pass; 1.A.2 absorbed into this task. CSV now 112/112 aligned. | 2h | dev | ✅ `python3 scripts/cross-reference-analytics-enum-csv.py` reports 0 missing |
| 1.A.2 | ~~Add 7 missing screens + 1 user property to CSV~~ **ROLLED INTO 1.A.1** — see above outcome. | 30m | dev | ✅ |
| 1.A.3 | ~~Wire iOS `ai_recommendation_accepted` + `ai_recommendation_dismissed` to the thumbs-up/down handler (or delete if not wanted)~~ **DELETED** 2026-05-13 — both events were duplicates of `home_ai_feedback_submitted` (which already carries `rating: positive/negative`). Enum 114 → 112; CSV stays aligned at 112/112. | 30m | dev | enum constants removed + CSV rows removed; cross-reference clean |
| 1.A.4 | ~~Wire fitme-story `design_system_component_expand` + `design_system_code_copy` (or delete)~~ **RE-CLASSIFIED as forward-declared** 2026-05-13 — helpers exist in fitme-story `src/lib/design-system-analytics.ts` awaiting UI; tagged `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` in CSV Notes per §5.4 convention. Phase 1.B gate honors this tag. | 30m | dev | `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` prefix in 2 CSV Notes + JSDoc `@forward-declared` on 2 helpers + master plan §5.4 convention added |
| 1.A.5 | Add tests for 21 untested iOS events (per-domain test files) | 2h | dev | `pytest` → coverage 100% |
| 1.A.6 | Add fitme-story `.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-xxxxxxx` placeholder | 5m | dev | file present |
| 1.A.7 | Refresh stale `.claude/shared/external-sync-status.json` analytics block | 15m | dev | `updated` field is today |

### §5.2 Success criteria

- `python3 scripts/cross-reference-analytics-enum-csv.py` exits 0 with "0 missing rows"
- `pytest FitTrackerTests/` analytics test coverage = 100% (114/114)
- No production code references `AnalyticsEvent.aiRecommendation*` that aren't actually firing
- `external-sync-status.json::analytics.instrumented_percentage` recomputed and current

### §5.3 Tests added (Phase 1.A)

- 21 new iOS analytics tests, one per untested event, in matching `*AnalyticsTests.swift` files
- (Forward-declared events `design_system_component_expand` + `design_system_code_copy` do not get tests in Phase 1.A — tests will be added when the UI ships; see §5.4 below)

### §5.4 Forward-Declared Events Convention (added 2026-05-13, Phase 1.A.4 resolution)

**Rule:** Analytics event constants + CSV rows may exist for events whose UI has not yet shipped, provided the CSV `Notes` column starts with the literal tag `[FORWARD-DECLARED]`.

**Rationale:** Forward-declaring an event helps the team agree on parameter names + GA4 routing **before** the UI lands. Deleting forward-declared events on every audit forces re-creation work when the UI ships, which is worse than maintaining the placeholder.

**Honored by:**
- `/analytics validate` skill: ignores `[FORWARD-DECLARED]`-tagged rows when computing "declared-but-unwired" metric
- Phase 1.B `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` gate: passes when an enum constant has a CSV row, regardless of wiring status, as long as the row exists
- (Future) Phase 1.B alternative gate `EVENT_UNWIRED_AND_NOT_FORWARD_DECLARED`: would fire if enum constant has 0 call sites AND CSV `Notes` lacks `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` prefix. (Considered for v8.0 — not in Phase 1.B initial scope to keep gate count minimal.)

**Current forward-declared events (2):**
- `design_system_component_expand` — helper at fitme-story `src/lib/design-system-analytics.ts:trackDesignSystemComponentExpand`; awaits ComponentCard expand UI
- `design_system_code_copy` — helper at fitme-story `src/lib/design-system-analytics.ts:trackDesignSystemCodeCopy`; awaits Copy snippet button UI

**When the UI ships:**
1. Wire the helper call from the new UI component
2. Remove the `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` tag from the CSV `Notes` column
3. Add 1+ unit test confirming the helper fires on the expected interaction
4. Update the implementing feature's state.json to record that the wiring took place

**Why this convention is safe:** the forward-declared tag is a STRUCTURED, machine-grep-able prefix. Phase 1.B `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` gate logic can branch on its presence/absence. Free-text "RESERVED" or "STUB" notes (which the previous CSV used) are unstructured and don't permit mechanical enforcement.

### §5.5 Phase 1.A current status (snapshot 2026-05-14)

**Status: COMPLETE — all 7 tasks shipped across 7 PRs.**

| Task | PR | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1.A.1 + 1.A.2 | [#334](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/334) | CSV 58 → 112 rows; 0 missing events / screens / user props |
| 1.A.3 | [#335](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/335) | `aiRecommendationAccepted/Dismissed` removed (duplicates); enum 114 → 112 |
| 1.A.4 | [#336](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/336) + fitme-story [#104](https://github.com/Regevba/fitme-story/pull/104) | 2 web events re-classified `[FORWARD-DECLARED]`; new convention §5.4 added |
| 1.A.5 | [#338](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/338) | 19 XCTests added; iOS test coverage 81% → 100% |
| 1.A.6 | fitme-story [#105](https://github.com/Regevba/fitme-story/pull/105) | 16 env vars documented in `.env.example` + `.gitignore` exception |
| 1.A.7 | [#339](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/339) | New `analytics_taxonomy_status` block in `external-sync-status.json`; freshness restored |

Plus parent feature scaffolding PR [#332](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/332) and docs spec completion PR [#337](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/337).

**Primary metric:** CSV taxonomy drift **56 → 0** ✅ (target met at Phase 1.A closure).

### §5.6 Phase 1.A-bis — Screen-view tracking gap (deferred to v7.9.1 or v8.0)

**Surfaced:** 2026-05-17 during FIT-142 iOS investigation (PR [#388](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/388)).

**Discovery:** Once the iOS firehose lit up (FIT-142 closure) + Firebase DebugView started streaming events, a structural gap in screen-view tracking became visible. The original Phase 1.A audit verified that **events** are wired (112 iOS enum entries + 100% test coverage) but did not check whether **screen-view modifiers** are applied across the app.

**The gap:**

```text
Onboarding flow (15 views):     analytics.logScreenView(AnalyticsScreen.<named>) ✅
Main app tabs (5 tabs):          ZERO explicit screen-view calls ❌
```

Files with screen-view calls (verified 2026-05-17 via grep): all 15 onboarding views call `analytics.logScreenView` directly (no modifier). The `AnalyticsScreenModifier` exists at `FitTracker/Services/Analytics/AnalyticsScreenModifier.swift:9` but is not applied to any view outside onboarding.

**Symptom in GA4 (verified via Firebase DebugView 2026-05-17):**

- Firebase auto-collects `screen_view` events for ALL views (no app code required) — BUT with `screen_class = "SwiftUIView"` for everything outside onboarding (generic SwiftUI hierarchy class, not feature-specific)
- Effect: GA4 funnels keyed on `screen_class` can't distinguish Home from Training from Stats from Nutrition from Settings — they all show as "SwiftUIView"
- Effect: screen-prefix funnel analysis (per `docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv` convention `home_*`, `training_*`, `stats_*`, etc.) doesn't work for the main app tabs

**Fix (D-3, scoped):**

```swift
// In each tab's root SwiftUI View:
.trackedScreen(AnalyticsScreen.home)         // MainScreenView / v2
.trackedScreen(AnalyticsScreen.training)     // TrainingPlanView
.trackedScreen(AnalyticsScreen.stats)        // (stats tab root)
.trackedScreen(AnalyticsScreen.nutrition)    // (nutrition tab root)
.trackedScreen(AnalyticsScreen.settings)     // SettingsView / v2
```

The `AnalyticsScreenModifier` already exists at line 9 — wiring is one modifier application per tab. Test plan: re-run app, verify `mcp__ga4__getEvents` returns `screen_view` events with proper `screen_class` for each of the 5 tabs.

**Why deferred (not done in PR #388):**

- D-3 is iOS code work (1-2h with verification)
- Adds new explicit `screen_view` events that **override** Firebase's auto-collection signal → changes screen-class distribution
- Mid-calibration shift in GA4 data shape contaminates v7.9 promotion telemetry (infra MP §2.2 criteria)
- Per §7.5 calibration safety classification: **🟡 yellow** — defer until 2026-06-04 (analytics MP §7.5 explicit policy)

**Earliest start:** 2026-06-04 (v7.9.1 window opens) per [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) §3.6.3.

**Tracking:**

- `state.json` task **D-3** (status: `deferred`, `blocked_until: "v7.9 ships"`)
- v8 docket candidate: **F21** (added to `state.json::v8_docket_candidates`)
- Analytics decisions log §13 (cross-references)

**Scope clarity — what this is NOT:**

- NOT a new gate (no `EVENT_SCREEN_VIEW_MISSING` write-time check)
- NOT a refactor of the screen-tracking architecture (existing modifier is sound)
- NOT a Phase 1.B gate-additive item (Phase 1.B adds `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` + `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` per §8)

**Companion follow-ups (also deferred to v7.9.1):**

- **D-2** — Configure GA4 conversions (`workout_complete`, `nutrition_meal_logged`). Per `docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv` "Conversion: Yes" column. 5-min GA4 UI toggle. Yellow class.
- **D-4** — Delete old `com.regevba.FitTracker` Firebase iOS app entry (legacy bundle no longer referenced by any runtime client). Green class, 1-min Firebase Console click.

See [`analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md`](analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md) §13 for the joint D-2/D-3/D-4 disposition.

## §6 Phase 2 — Live Debugger (window 2026-05-15 → 22, ~8h, non-gate, parallel with Phase 1.A)

### §6.1 Sub-system A: Local mirror sink

**Architecture:** websocket server on `localhost:8765`. iOS DebugSinkAdapter (when `DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1`) tees every `logEvent` payload to the websocket; web mirror function (when `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1`) tees every `sendGAEvent`.

**Files:**
- New: `scripts/analytics-watch-server.py` (websocket server, optional `--port`, `--no-color`, `--filter` args)
- New: `FitTracker/Services/Analytics/DebugSinkAdapter.swift` (wraps existing FirebaseAnalyticsAdapter; tees events when env flag set)
- New: `fitme-story/src/lib/analytics-debug-mirror.ts` (wraps `sendGAEvent`; tees when env flag set)

**`/analytics watch` CLI:** new sub-command added to `.claude/skills/analytics/SKILL.md`. Connects to `ws://localhost:8765/events`, prints each event as it arrives with timestamp + event name + parameters. Supports `--filter <name>` and `--funnel <step1,step2,...>`.

### §6.2 Sub-system B: GA4 Realtime poll

**Architecture:** new sub-command `/analytics poll` queries GA4 Realtime API via `mcp-server-ga4`. Polls every 30 seconds (configurable). Prints active event counts.

**Files:**
- New: `.claude/skills/analytics/SKILL.md` adds `/analytics poll` sub-command
- Update: `.claude/integrations/ga4/adapter.md` adds "Realtime poll" mode (currently only describes `run_report`)
- Operator: connect GA4 MCP (one-time): export `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`, install `mcp-server-ga4`, configure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. Operator runbook in `docs/setup/ga4-mcp-setup-guide.md` (new).

### §6.3 Success criteria

- Run `python3 scripts/analytics-watch-server.py &`; launch iOS app with `DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1` scheme; fire test event; see event in CLI within 100ms.
- Run `/analytics poll` against connected GA4 MCP; see event counts within 30s of firing.

### §6.4 Tests added (Phase 2)

- `scripts/tests/test_analytics_watch_server.py` — 7 tests (POST /event shape, GET /stream subscriber registration, GET /health, filter, malformed payload, port collision detection, multi-subscriber broadcast)
- `scripts/tests/test_analytics_watch.py` — 12 tests (CLI flag parsing + 5 integration tests via subprocess + reactive stdout reading)
- `FitTrackerTests/DebugSinkAdapterTests.swift` — 14 tests (passthrough, tee, PII safety for setUserProperty/setUserID/setConsent, env discrimination, sink override)
- fitme-story `src/lib/__tests__/analytics-debug-mirror.test.ts` — 8 node:test tests (env-gated resolveSinkURL + fetch shape + failure swallowing)

### §6.5 Phase 2 current status (snapshot 2026-05-14)

**Status: COMPLETE — all 5 sub-tasks shipped across 5 PRs.**

| Task | PR | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2.A.1 SSE mirror server | [#342](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/342) (squash `353b142`) | stdlib-only HTTP+SSE on `localhost:8765`; endpoints POST /event, GET /stream, GET /health |
| 2.A.2 `/analytics watch` CLI | [#345](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/345) | stdlib client with `--filter`, `--raw`, `--no-color`, `--server` |
| 2.A.3 iOS DebugSinkAdapter | [#349](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/349) | wraps inner `AnalyticsProvider`; tees `logEvent` + `logScreenView` when `DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1`; PII safe (never tees setUserProperty/setUserID/setConsent) |
| 2.A.4 fitme-story web mirror | fitme-story [#107](https://github.com/Regevba/fitme-story/pull/107) (squash `1ec463c`) | `analytics-debug-mirror.ts` tees gtag emits when `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1`; fire-and-forget fetch with `keepalive: true` |
| 2.B.1 `/analytics poll` + GA4 MCP runbook | [#351](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/351) (squash `0b1f661`) | new `docs/setup/ga4-mcp-setup-guide.md` (~270 lines, 7-step operator runbook) + `/analytics poll` SKILL.md procedure expanded from placeholder to full 5-step MCP-driven query |

**Phase 2 deliverables — verification at close:**
- `pytest scripts/tests/` — 152/152 pass
- `make schema-check` — 70/70 state.json clean
- iOS `DebugSinkAdapterTests` — 14/14 (verified on PR #349 + #351 Build and Test)
- fitme-story node:test — 8/8

---

## §7 Phase 3 — Dashboards (window 2026-05-21 → 06-04, ~10h, non-gate, parallel with v7.9 Phase E monitoring)

### §7.1 Sub-system A: `/control-room/analytics` route (fitme-story)

**Architecture:** new Next.js App Router route. Server component fetches GA4 data via MCP at request time; client islands render tiles. Reuses existing passkey auth + control-room layout.

**Cache strategy** (per `next-cache-components` skill):
- Static shell: header + navigation (auto-prerendered)
- Cached: 5-minute event firing rate tiles (`use cache; cacheLife('minutes')`)
- Dynamic: live "last 10 events" stream (Suspense + Streaming)

**Files:**
- New: `fitme-story/src/app/control-room/analytics/page.tsx`
- New: `fitme-story/src/components/control-room/AnalyticsTiles.tsx`
- New: `fitme-story/src/components/control-room/EventFiringRateChart.tsx`
- New: `fitme-story/src/components/control-room/TaxonomyComplianceSummary.tsx`
- New: `fitme-story/src/lib/control-room/ga4-mcp-client.ts` (wraps mcp-server-ga4 read calls)

**Optional (deferred to v8.x):** Workflow DevKit for long-running funnel re-aggregation jobs. Phase 3 ships with simpler poll-based data; Workflow integration in v8.0 if usage demands it.

### §7.2 Sub-system B: Looker Studio template

**Files:**
- New: `docs/analytics/looker-studio-template.json` — exportable Looker dashboard definition
- New: `docs/analytics/looker-studio-template.md` — operator import guide (1 page)
- Defines: funnel exploration, event-name distribution, cohort retention, conversion-event tracking

### §7.3 Success criteria

- Operator authenticates to `/control-room/analytics` via passkey
- Page loads in <3s including GA4 MCP roundtrip
- Tiles update on F5 refresh
- Looker template imports cleanly into a fresh Looker workspace; charts populate from GA4

### §7.4 Tests added (Phase 3)

- `fitme-story/src/lib/control-room/__tests__/ga4-mcp-client.test.ts` — 5 tests (response shape, error fallback, retry, cache hit) — **deferred to live-wiring sub-task**
- Vercel verification skill protocol: open route in browser, verify GA4 round-trip end-to-end — **deferred to live-wiring sub-task**
- `fitme-story/src/lib/control-room/__tests__/analytics-tile-fixtures.test.ts` — fixture-shape + render tests (ships with scaffold)

### §7.5 Calibration safety: green / yellow / red work classification (added 2026-05-14)

Phase 1.B's Calibration Protocol opens **2026-06-04** and measures (a) `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` baseline drift count and (b) `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` connection success rate. To preserve the integrity of that ≥7-day soak window, Phase 3 work between now and 2026-06-04 is partitioned into three buckets:

#### 🟢 Green — safe to ship now (zero contamination risk)

Pure scaffold + spec work. Does **not** modify source-of-truth ledgers (CSV taxonomy, `external-sync-status.json::analytics_taxonomy_status`, GA4 properties), does **not** add new GA4 instrumentation, does **not** read live GA4.

| # | Item | Repo | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Route shell at `/control-room/analytics` | fitme-story | `src/app/control-room/analytics/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` |
| 2 | Sidebar nav entry | fitme-story | `src/components/control-room/Sidebar.tsx` (or equivalent) |
| 3 | Tile component scaffolding | fitme-story | `src/components/control-room/EventVolumeTile.tsx`, `DriftTrendTile.tsx`, `TaxonomyHealthTile.tsx` |
| 4 | Data-fetcher TypeScript contracts | fitme-story | `src/lib/control-room/analytics-types.ts` |
| 5 | Looker Studio template (JSON/markdown spec) | FT2 | `docs/analytics/looker-studio-template.json` + `.md` |
| 6 | Metric definitions doc | FT2 | `docs/master-plan/analytics-dashboard-metric-definitions.md` |
| 7 | Vitest/RTL test harness with fixture data | fitme-story | `src/lib/control-room/__tests__/analytics-tile-fixtures.test.ts` + `analytics-fixtures.ts` |
| 8 | Operator runbook | FT2 | `docs/setup/control-room-analytics-setup-guide.md` |
| 9 | State.json + log entries for Phase 3 sub-tasks | FT2 | `.claude/features/analytics-observability/state.json`, `.claude/logs/analytics-observability.log.json` |

#### 🟡 Yellow — defer until 2026-06-04 (low but real contamination risk)

Live-data wiring. Quota use is fine in absolute terms but adds variance to the GA4 MCP success-rate baseline OR forward-biases drift snapshots.

- Wiring tiles to live GA4 Reporting API via `mcp-server-ga4` — adds variance to `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` success-rate baseline
- Wiring tiles to live `external-sync-status.json::analytics_taxonomy_status` reads — read-only is OK, but if the dashboard *triggers* a refresh-on-load it would forward-bias drift snapshots
- Adding new GA4 instrumentation for the dashboard itself (`analytics_dashboard_view`, `analytics_dashboard_tile_interaction`, etc.) — pollutes event-volume baseline

#### 🔴 Red — never do during the soak window (will contaminate)

- Modifying [`docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv`](../product/analytics-taxonomy.csv) — would re-baseline drift from 0 to non-zero and reset the calibration clock
- Promoting `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` or `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` from advisory to enforced before 2026-06-04 — violates the Calibration Protocol contract
- Backfilling events / replaying historical traffic into GA4 — corrupts event-volume baseline

#### Re-evaluation trigger

After 2026-06-04 (or at the formal Phase 1.B Calibration Protocol kickoff per [infra master plan §3.5](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md)), the yellow bucket re-classifies to green. Red items remain red until both Phase 1.B gates flip to enforced (earliest 2026-06-18 per §8.1).

### §7.6 Phase 3 current status (snapshot 2026-05-14)

**Status: SCAFFOLD IN PROGRESS — green-bucket items 1–9 shipping under PR (TBD).**

| Sub-system | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 7.1.A route shell | green #1, #2 | scaffold this PR |
| 7.1.A tiles | green #3 | scaffold this PR |
| 7.1.A live GA4 wiring | yellow | deferred — earliest 2026-06-04 |
| 7.1.A `analytics_dashboard_view` event | yellow | deferred — earliest 2026-06-04 |
| 7.2.B Looker template | green #5 | spec this PR |
| 7.2.B operator runbook | green #8 | spec this PR |

Phase 3 close trigger: green scaffold merged + (after 2026-06-04) yellow live-wiring shipped + Vercel verification passes + operator opens dashboard end-to-end.

## §8 Phase 1.B — Gates (window 2026-06-04 → 06-26, ~6h, **2 new gates**)

### §8.1 Calibration Protocol mapping (per infra plan §3.5)

| Date | Phase | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-04 | A → B transition | Ship advisory; both gates emit `gate-coverage.jsonl` rows |
| 2026-06-04 → 06-11 | B (advisory + measure) | ≥7 days telemetry collection; operator T+3d checkpoint on 2026-06-07 |
| 2026-06-11 → 06-18 | C (calibration gate) | ≥N=5 fires per gate; 0 false positives confirmed by operator review; all skip reasons documented |
| 2026-06-18 | D (promotion decision) | Flip to enforced OR stay advisory; rollback path rehearsed |
| 2026-06-18 → 06-25 | E (post-promotion validation) | Continuous monitoring; rollback if false positive incident |
| 2026-06-26 | analytics-observability `current_phase: complete` | Triggers 3D Framework Universe auto-resume |

### §8.2 Gate 1: `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT`

**Fires:** pre-commit, when staged files include `FitTracker/Services/Analytics/AnalyticsProvider.swift` modifications.

**Rule:** every event constant added to the `AnalyticsEvent` enum must have a corresponding row in [`docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv`](../product/analytics-taxonomy.csv) within the same commit (or a documented exemption tag).

**Exemption:** state.json `csv_taxonomy_exempt: [{constant: "name", reason: "..."}]` array on feature state.json bypasses for justified cases (e.g., a constant temporarily defined during a refactor).

**Files:**
- Update: `scripts/check-state-schema.py` adds `check_csv_taxonomy_drift()` function emitting `coverage.candidate("CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT")`
- Update: `.githooks/pre-commit` header bumped to mention new gate
- New: `scripts/tests/test_csv_taxonomy_drift.py` (positive + negative fixtures + dispatch test per F14 pattern)

**Reversibility contract:**
- Advisory rollback: <2 min (set function early-return)
- Enforced rollback: <5 min (single-line flag flip + hook header bump)
- Rehearsed at Phase D before flip

### §8.3 Gate 2: `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED`

**Fires:** pre-commit, when staged files include analytics-affecting code (`FitTracker/Services/Analytics/*` OR `fitme-story/src/lib/control-room/analytics.ts` OR taxonomy CSV).

**Rule:** check that GA4 MCP is reachable via env vars (`GA4_PROPERTY_ID` set + `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` file exists). If disconnected, advisory finding (not blocking).

**Note:** advisory only — never blocks commits, even when promoted to "enforced" status. The gate exists to surface drift, not to gate analytics work behind operator GA4 setup. Promoted means it emits a clear finding visible in `make integrity-check`, not that it returns non-zero exit.

**Files:**
- Update: `scripts/check-state-schema.py` adds `check_ga4_mcp_connectivity()` function
- Update: `.githooks/pre-commit` header bumped
- New: `scripts/tests/test_ga4_mcp_disconnected.py`

### §8.4 Phase A artifacts (pre-merge requirements per §3.5.1)

For both gates, before merging Phase 1.B PR:

- [ ] Gate spec section in this doc (§8.2 + §8.3) — ✅ written
- [ ] 1 positive fixture per gate (`tests/fixtures/gate-fixtures/CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT/positive/`)
- [ ] 1 negative fixture per gate (`tests/fixtures/gate-fixtures/CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT/negative/`)
- [ ] Dispatch regression test: asserts `coverage.candidate(GATE)` fires under expected input partition

These ride on F16 try-repo harness when it ships v7.9.1 (~2026-06-11). Phase 1.B fixture authoring CAN start before F16 ships; harness integration finalizes after.

---

## §9 Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2026-05-13) | Phase 1.A target | Phase 1.B target | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PRIMARY:** CSV taxonomy drift (missing rows) | 56 | 0 | 0 (gated) | `cross-reference-analytics-enum-csv.py` |
| iOS event test coverage | 81% (93/114) | 100% (114/114) | 100% (gated) | `pytest FitTrackerTests/` |
| Declared-but-unfired iOS events | 4 | 0 | 0 | `grep AnalyticsEvent.X across FitTracker/` |
| Declared-but-unwired web events | 2 | 0 | 0 | call-site grep |
| GA4 MCP connectivity | disconnected | (Phase 2: operator setup) | connected | `gh api ... GA4_PROPERTY_ID secret` |
| `external-sync-status.json::analytics.instrumented_percentage` | 35% (stale) | recomputed | ≥80% | `make analytics-instrumentation-summary` |

### §9.1 Kill criteria

**Phase 1.B kill condition:** if either gate produces >5% false positive rate during 7-day Phase C calibration window (2026-06-11 → 06-18), defer enforcement to v7.10. analytics-observability still ships as "Phase 1.A + 2 + 3 complete; gates advisory permanent".

**Phase 2 kill condition:** if local mirror sink causes any production crash, performance regression, or PII leak in 7-day soak post-merge, revert immediately and ship Phase 2 as "GA4 Realtime poll only".

**Phase 3 kill condition:** if `/control-room/analytics` page load exceeds 5s P95, scope down to "tiles only" (no live event stream).

## §10 Risk Register (additions beyond infra master plan §7)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| GA4 MCP setup failure (auth/propertyId/service account) | Medium | Medium | Operator runbook in `docs/setup/ga4-mcp-setup-guide.md` covers all 3 failure modes; advisory `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` gate makes drift visible |
| Local mirror websocket port (8765) collision with dev tool | Low | Low | `--port` CLI arg; clear "port in use" error |
| Looker Studio template auth (operator OAuth) | Low | Low | Template instruction in MD; not automatable |
| CSV ownership dispute (FT2 vs fitme-story) | Resolved | — | §6.2 of decisions log: single canonical in FT2 + D-1 reverse-sync to fitme-story |
| Phase 1.B gate enforcement during Phase E freeze window | Resolved | — | Phase 1.B starts 2026-06-04 (after Phase E exit); enforcement at earliest 2026-06-18 |
| Phase 2 debugger leaks PII to local sink | Low | High | Mirror is OFF by default; activates only under `DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1` env flag; documented in dev guide |
| F16 try-repo harness slips past 2026-06-11 | Medium | Low | Phase 1.B fixtures can be authored without harness; integration deferred if F16 slips; gates ship advisory regardless |

**Parent epic:** to be created on Phase 1 PRD approval. Likely ~FIT-138+ (Linear MCP at issue-creation time; do not trust documentation for numbering).

**Proposed child issues (one per sub-track):**

| # | Title | Phase | Effort | Window |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 1.A.1-2 — CSV taxonomy backfill (56 rows + 7 screens + 1 user prop) | 1.A | 2.5h | 2026-05-15 → 17 |

- v7.8.3 D-1 reverse-sync (extends to CSV mirror to fitme-story build)

### §14.5 Observed Patterns Catalog applicability

This feature both **consumes** existing entries in [`.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md`](../../.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md) and **adds** new entries when its gates ship. Cross-references:

| Catalog entry | How analytics-observability uses it |
|---|---|
| **#2** `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INACTIVE` | This feature's own state.json is currently flagged (9 Read events attributed via Mechanism C, no `cache_hits[]`). Expected per pattern — v7.8.x advisory, auto-resolves when v7.9 promotes Mechanism C dual-write. No action. |
| **#1** `BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL` | Will fire on this feature if its branches get squash-merged + cleanup-deleted before the catalog's signal-vs-noise check is run. Per pattern: cleanup-artifact, confirmed via PR `head_ref`. |
| **#3** `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B | Phase 1.B gate work (2026-06-04+) is infra-path (`scripts/check-state-schema.py`, `.githooks/pre-commit`); Mode B WILL fire correctly on commits to those files. Mandatory: ship on a `chore/*` or `feat/*` branch. |
| **#5** `ISOLATION_OPT_OUT_REASON_MISSING` | This feature has `isolation_opt_out: false` in state.json (sub-branches per phase), so this gate should not fire. If a sub-task needs metadata-only commits to main, opt out + document reason. |
| **#6** `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` | Fires at `current_phase=complete`. Spec mandates filling all 7 frontmatter fields in `analytics-observability-case-study.md` before closing (incl. `kill_criteria_resolution` per Q7). |
| **#14** `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_TIER_TAGS` | Case study dated post-2026-04-21 → must carry T1/T2/T3 tier tags on every quantitative claim. Mandatory at closure. |
| **#21** `case_study_type` exemption tags | This feature is NOT exempt — `case_study_type` is absent in state.json by design; must produce a real case study. |
| **NEW (post-1.B ship)** `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` | Will be added as catalog entry #24 the moment Phase 1.B gate ships. Document the trigger, the `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` exemption (per §5.4), and the silence path. |
| **NEW (post-1.B ship)** `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` | Will be added as catalog entry #25. Document that it is always advisory (never blocks), as a clear "GA4 reachability unknown" signal. |

**Operator obligation:** when Phase 1.B ships, the closing PR MUST append entries #24 and #25 to `.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md` — the catalog's mandatory-update rule (per [PR #328](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/328)) makes this non-optional.

## §16 Operational Runbook

How to operate each phase post-ship. Each subsection is the survival kit for an operator (you or me) coming in cold to maintain the feature.

### §16.1 Phase 1.A — Hygiene maintenance

**Regular operation:** none. The CSV is authored manually; the cross-reference script is the safety net.

**On regression:** if `python3 scripts/cross-reference-analytics-enum-csv.py` flags drift (after Phase 1.B gate enforces it should be impossible without bypass), pull the offending feature branch, add the missing row(s), recommit. Pattern #24 (post-Phase-1.B) will document the exact remediation.

**Adding a new analytics event:** define in `AnalyticsEvent` enum → add CSV row (with `Notes` field; use `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` if UI not wired yet) → add 1+ test in matching `*AnalyticsTests.swift` file → commit on a feature branch. Mode B will fire because pre-commit hooks live in `.githooks/`; that's expected per pattern #3.

**Refresh stale `external-sync-status.json`:** `make analytics-instrumentation-summary` (added during 1.A.7); writes today's date + percentage to the analytics block.

### §16.2 Phase 2 — Live debugger operation

**Local mirror (DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1) — daily dev use:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: start the mirror server
python3 scripts/analytics-watch-server.py --port 8765

# Terminal 2: tail events
/analytics watch                     # all events
/analytics watch --filter onboarding # only onboarding_*
/analytics watch --funnel sign_in,onboarding_step_viewed,onboarding_step_completed

# Then run the app:
#   iOS: set DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1 in scheme env → launch Simulator
#   Web: NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1 npm run dev
```

**Port collision:** server exits with "port 8765 in use". Pass `--port 8766` and override the iOS/web env var to match.

**PII safety:** mirror is **off by default**. The DebugSinkAdapter is a pass-through wrapper; if the env flag isn't set, it returns the underlying FirebaseAnalyticsAdapter unchanged. No code path writes to the websocket unless the env flag is set. Confirm in code review at every Phase 2 PR.

**GA4 Realtime poll (`/analytics poll`):**

```bash
# One-time: connect GA4 MCP
export GA4_PROPERTY_ID=<your-property-id>
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.json
# (see docs/setup/ga4-mcp-setup-guide.md for the full setup)

/analytics poll                    # default 30s interval
/analytics poll --interval 10s     # faster for active dev
/analytics poll --event app_open   # single-event focus
```

**On auth failure:** advisory `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` will surface; resolve service-account JSON file path + IAM role (`roles/analytics.viewer` on the property), retry. Never log credentials.

### §16.3 Phase 3 — Dashboard operation

**`/control-room/analytics` (fitme-story):**

- Auth: passkey (reuses `ucc-passkey-auth` from 2026-05-07; same operator credentials)
- Page load: <3s target including GA4 MCP roundtrip
- Cache: 5-minute tiles via `use cache; cacheLife('minutes')` (per `next-cache-components` skill)
- Live "last 10 events" stream: Suspense + Streaming, no cache

**On GA4 MCP timeout:** the route degrades to "tiles only" with a banner explaining the live stream is unavailable. The 5-minute cached tiles continue to serve.

**On stale data:** force-refresh with F5 invalidates the `cacheTag` set on the GA4 fetch. If cache is wrong for >10 minutes, check the cache tag invalidation in `ga4-mcp-client.ts`.

**Looker Studio template:**

- Operator imports `docs/analytics/looker-studio-template.json` into Looker once
- Charts auto-populate from the configured GA4 property
- No runtime cost; template is operator-owned post-import

### §16.4 Phase 1.B — Gate operation

**Once `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` is enforced (~2026-06-18):**

- Pre-commit hook rejects commits where an `AnalyticsEvent` enum constant is added without a matching CSV row
- Operator hits this → add the CSV row, restage, recommit
- Legit forward-declared events: pre-add the CSV row tagged `[FORWARD-DECLARED]` BEFORE the enum constant. Gate honors the tag.
- Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify` (logged; 72h cycle catches the resulting drift)

**`GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` (always advisory):**

- Emits to `gate-coverage.jsonl` + `make integrity-check` finding when env vars unset
- Never blocks
- Resolves naturally when operator runs `gcloud auth application-default login` + sets `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`

**Reversibility:**

- Rollback CSV gate to advisory: edit `scripts/check-state-schema.py` → set function early-return → push patch (<2 min)
- Rollback GA4 advisory off entirely: same path (<5 min)
- Both rehearsed at Phase D before Phase 1.B promotion (~2026-06-18)

| 3.A (control-room route) | 2026-05-21 | v7.9 Phase E entered (parallel monitoring); passkey auth from `ucc-passkey-auth` still operational |
| 3.B (Looker template) | 2026-05-21 | None |
| 1.B.1 (CSV gate) | 2026-06-04 | v7.9 Phase E EXITED (Layer Stacking Rule per infra plan §3.5.2); F16 try-repo harness optional but recommended |
| 1.B.2 (GA4 advisory gate) | 2026-06-04 | Same |
| 1.B.3 (calibration) | 2026-06-11 | 1.B.1 + 1.B.2 in Phase B (advisory mode) for ≥7 days |
| 1.B.4 (promotion decision) | 2026-06-18 | 1.B.3 calibration shows ≤5% FP rate per gate |

### §17.3 Calendar conflicts already resolved

| Conflict | Resolution | Captured in |
|---|---|---|
| v7.8.5 cache_hits keying patch competing for CI/SSD | Phase 1.A starts 2026-05-15 (after v7.8.5 ship) | `state.json::launch_window` |
| v7.9 Phase E freeze (no new gates 2026-05-21→06-04) | Phase 1.B starts 2026-06-04 (post Phase E exit) | `state.json::launch_window` + §8.1 |
| 22-day Calibration Protocol (infra plan §3.5) | Phase 1.B follows A→B→C→D→E with explicit per-stage dates | §8.1 |
| Layer Stacking Rule (infra plan §3.5.2) | Phase 1.B gates ride on Mechanism A, which exits Phase E ~2026-06-04 if v7.9 promotes 2026-05-21 | §17.2 |
| Active feature collision (3D vs analytics) | 3D parked (`scheduled_after: analytics-observability.complete`); analytics-observability is the live `.claude/active-feature` | state.json + §14.4 |
| HADF Phase 2-bis Sub-exp 1 (2026-05-23) | Different team-track; no shared resources | None — independent track |
| v7.8.5 + #336 + #335 + #334 + #332 already shipped | §5.5 snapshot table | §5.5 |
