# FitMe Infra Master Plan & Roadmap — 2026-05-12

> **Status:** CURRENT · Opened 2026-05-12 (one day after v7.8.3 cross-repo state-sync shipped)
> **Scope:** Framework infrastructure only — write-time gates, cycle-time checks, branch-isolation tooling, cross-repo sync, measurement infrastructure, and the HADF/ORCHID research substrate that depends on it. Product features tracked separately in [`master-plan-2026-04-15.md`](master-plan-2026-04-15.md) + [`master-backlog-roadmap.md`](master-backlog-roadmap.md).
> **Purpose:** Single forward-looking source of truth for framework v7.9 promotion, v8.x candidate ranking, HADF Phase 2-bis pre-launch dependencies, and the measurement / promotion calendar through Q3 2026.
> **Supersedes:** ad-hoc v7.9 candidate lists in [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md), [`docs/case-studies/cross-repo-state-sync-impl-case-study.md`](../case-studies/cross-repo-state-sync-impl-case-study.md), and the stress-test case study Section 99 — all are referenced and folded in here.

## 0. TL;DR

Four streams of work converge on the infra surface as of 2026-05-12 (updated end-of-day after PR #317 + PR #318; refreshed 2026-05-22 post-v7.9 ship):

1. **v7.9 is a *promotion* release, not a feature release. SHIPPED 2026-05-21 via PR #417 (`ea53ff4`).** Single-line flip at [`scripts/check-state-schema.py:132`](../../scripts/check-state-schema.py) (`BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = True → False`) drove 3 promoted gates simultaneously: `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B + Mode C + `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS`. All 4 §2.2 promotion criteria GREEN against 14d Mechanism A telemetry (18 + 13 + 13 firings, 0 zero-candidate rows, all skip-reasons legitimate). Phase E validation soak runs **2026-05-21 → 2026-06-04**; B2 post-v7.9 baseline snapshot scheduled **2026-05-28**; v7.9.1 build window opens ~**2026-06-04**. Total framework mechanisms post-promotion: **37 mechanical gates + 5 advisories** (3 advisories promoted). Substantive new build routes through v8.x.
2. **v7.8.5 — pre-promotion remediation patch (NEW, added 2026-05-12).** PR #317 fixed a silent-pass bug (`BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B unreachable when no state.json staged) and the follow-up audit surfaced 4 currently-failing tests in `test_gate_coverage.py` whose `KeyError: 'CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6'` may indicate a hidden silent-pass left by the v7.8.3 rename to `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT`. If true, the v7.8 → v7.9 calibration data feeding the 2026-05-21 decision is keyed wrong. Triage + fix should ship as v7.8.5 BEFORE the promotion decision; otherwise the entire quantitative input stream is corrupted. See §2.4.
3. **v8.x is a *feature* release with 18 F-candidates + 7 V8-I icebox items = 25 total queued.** F1–F18 across four source sessions (roadmap stress-test 2026-05-07, branch-isolation closure 2026-05-07, v7.8.3 cutover dogfood 2026-05-11, PR #317 + test-suite audit 2026-05-12) plus V8-I1–V8-I7 from [`branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md). The 2026-05-12 expansion added **Theme G — Test discipline** (F14–F18) that closes the same vulnerability class PR #317 fixed. Full forward plan v7.9 → v8.2 at §3.6.
4. **HADF Phase 2-bis is the only active infra-adjacent research build right now.** Block A scaffolding SHIPPED 2026-05-12 via PR #316 (13 tasks A0–A12, 15 commits). State.json `current_phase: tasks_phase`. Block B Sub-exp 1 collection calendar-gated 2026-05-23 (T+12d v7.8.3 soak); 3 sub-experiments + cross-synthesis case study run through approximately **2026-06-07**. Track 6 HADF gate activation (currently Q3=OUT of Phase 2-bis scope) becomes eligible post Phase 2-bis closure ~2026-06-07.

**Calibration protocol added 2026-05-12 (§3.5):** every new layer of framework infrastructure now requires a documented pre-build calibration window where telemetry from the prior layer proves it fires correctly under load. This codifies the "advisory → enforced after measurement" pattern that v7.8 introduced informally.

## 1. v7.8.3 Anchor — What's Already Shipped

The v7.8.3 cross-repo state-sync umbrella shipped 2026-05-11 across 10 PRs in a single-day subagent-driven build. The infra surface at end-of-day was:

- **33 mechanical gates** (write-time + cycle-time, was 30 at v7.8.1)
- **5 advisory gates** (cycle-time only; advisory pending data accumulation)
- **62 features** with `state_owner ∈ {ft2, fitme-story}` backfilled
- **47 features** with full v7.8 schema bridge fields populated
- **1 reverse-sync GitHub Action** live in fitme-story (D-1)
- **1 unified PR-cite cache** (`scripts/refresh-pr-cache.py` + multi-repo `_load_pr_cache`) — 63/63 retroactive citation validation pass
- **1 cross-repo telemetry aggregator** (`src/lib/control-room/gate-coverage-aggregator.ts` in fitme-story) for `gate-coverage.jsonl` from both repos
- **1 phase-snapshot protocol** (`make snapshot-phase` → `scripts/snapshot-phase-completion.sh`) for off-SSD per-phase backups

Detailed inventory of what shipped + how the 3-attempt cutover ceremony surfaced F11/F12/F13: [`docs/case-studies/cross-repo-state-sync-impl-case-study.md`](../case-studies/cross-repo-state-sync-impl-case-study.md).

### 1.1 v7.8.4 + PR #317 + PR #318 (2026-05-12 additions)

**v7.8.4** shipped 2026-05-12 morning via PR #314 + PR #297 + companion doc-sync. Adds the `PR_CACHE_STALE` auto-refresh gate (closes the 33-finding false-positive incident from empty PR cache) + narrows `TIER_TAG_LIKELY_INCORRECT` heuristic + introduces `.claude/shared/case-study-t1-references.json` reference ledger. Single operability gate added (`PR_CACHE_STALE`); total mechanical gates 33 → 34.

**PR #317** (`fix(framework): BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION Mode B silent-pass on infra-only commits`) shipped 2026-05-12 afternoon. Reordered `scripts/check-state-schema.py:main()` so the Mode B check + gate-coverage ledger write happen BEFORE the no-state-files early-return. Added 2 regression tests that drive `main()` end-to-end. No new mechanism; closes a 5+ day silent-pass window that affected ~9 HADF Phase 2-bis Block A commits.

**PR #318** (`docs(v7-9-candidates):` F14–F18 from PR #317 + test-suite audit + external research) shipped 2026-05-12 evening. Expanded the v7.9 candidates spec from 13 to 18 items (Theme G — Test discipline). Documented pre-promotion remediation flag for cache_hits keying.

**Inventory delta:** 33 → 34 mechanical gates; 5 advisory unchanged; F-candidate count 13 → 18.

### 1.2 v7.8.5 + v7.8.6 (2026-05-13 → 2026-05-15 additions)

**v7.8.5** shipped 2026-05-13 — observability layer with no new gates. Adds the Observed Patterns Catalog ([`.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md`](../../.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md), 23 gate patterns + 9 workflow patterns) and the W9 branch-drift real-time alert (PostToolUse:Bash hook). Mandatory operator rule: any novel pattern surfaced during a session must be appended to the catalog before the protocol closes the feature. Shipped via PR #328 (catalog) + PR #341 (W9 hook).

**v7.8.6** shipped 2026-05-15 — **cadence batch closing the 96-hour drift window** identified in `docs/master-plan/data-integrity-and-rollback-2026-05-14.md` §2.1+§2.3. Pure observability surfaces (no enforcement-gate changes). Two PRs:

- **PR #363 (MUST batch):** `make integrity-diff` vs 2026-05-14 anchor + `make preflight WORK_TYPE=<type>` unified entry point + W1 ssh-agent SessionStart preflight + weekly Mechanism A gate-coverage zero-drift scan + per-dimension trend nudge in `framework-status-weekly.yml`. Mandatory Phase 0.0 step added to `/pm-workflow`. All 10 skills point at `.claude/shared/preflight-cache.json` in their `## Shared Data` section. New ledger: `.claude/shared/gate-coverage-weekly.jsonl` (append-only, populated on first weekly cron). Cadence-followups tracker at `.claude/shared/must-have-cadence-followups.md` with daily ≤14d lookahead.
- **PR #365 (nice-to-have batch):** `.github/workflows/dependency-audit-weekly.yml` + `scripts/aggregate-dependency-audit.py` (Mondays 06:00 UTC, 1h after framework-status-weekly). Daily-checkpoint extension: stale-branch warning (`[gone]` local branches + orphan worktrees) + PR-babysit sweep (open PRs idle >24h, cross-repo).

**Inventory delta:** 34 mechanical gates unchanged; 5 advisory unchanged. New observability surfaces: 2 Makefile targets (`integrity-diff`, `preflight`), 1 new cache ledger (`preflight-cache.json` — gitignored, per-session), 1 new append-only ledger (`gate-coverage-weekly.jsonl`), 2 new GH Actions workflows (extension of `framework-status-weekly` + new `dependency-audit-weekly`), 3 new SessionStart / daily-checkpoint output sections (W1 ssh-agent, stale-branch, PR babysit).

**Why ship against the plan now:** master plan §2.2 promotion criterion #2 ("no false positives") + criterion #1 ("Mechanism A coverage validated") are measured against the 2026-05-14 baseline. v7.8.6 makes drift-vs-baseline a single command — operators can verify the 2026-05-21 promotion decision against fresh telemetry without manual ledger-diffing.

### 1.3 UCC passkey cutover (2026-05-16 additions)

`ucc-passkey-auth` cutover Parts 1-6 executed 2026-05-16 (feature shipped 2026-05-07, dormant at `UCC_AUTH_MODE=basic` for 9 days). The `fitme-story.vercel.app/control-room/*` operator dashboard now runs at `UCC_AUTH_MODE=both` — passkey AND legacy basic-auth both accepted; rollback is a single env-var flip. Touches no framework-gate code; no Mechanism A telemetry contamination during 2026-05-15 → 05-21 calibration window. 9 cadence-followups added to [`must-have-cadence-followups.md`](../../.claude/shared/must-have-cadence-followups.md): B7 (Part 9 audit-log GHA, 2026-05-17), B8 (T+7d kill-criteria checkpoint 2026-05-23), B9 (Part 8 passkey-only flip 2026-05-28+), C4-C8 (Part 7 break-glass + Part 10 panel verify + 3 operability fixes deferred past v7.9), C9-C10 (P2 UX polish — coral pulse animation + 4 control-room dark-mode contrast verifications). Source case study §99: [`docs/case-studies/ucc-passkey-auth-case-study.md`](../case-studies/ucc-passkey-auth-case-study.md).

**Inventory delta:** 0 mechanical gates changed; 0 advisory changed; 0 new telemetry candidates. Pure operational rollout.

## 2. Promotion Docket (v7.9 → enforced, decision 2026-05-21)

These items already exist as advisory gates. The v7.9 decision is *whether to flip them to enforced* — not whether to build them. Each flip is data-gated on `gate-coverage.jsonl` telemetry showing the gate fires correctly under load with zero false positives.

### 2.1 Advisory → Enforced Calendar

| Gate | Advisory ship | Telemetry window | Earliest enforce | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` (Modes B + C) | v7.8.1 (2026-05-07) | 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-21 (14d) | **2026-05-21** | [v7.8.1 spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-02-framework-v7-8-and-v7-9-bridge-design.md) |
| `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` | v7.8.1 (2026-05-07) | 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-21 (14d) | **2026-05-21** | [v7.8.1 spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-02-framework-v7-8-and-v7-9-bridge-design.md) |
| Mechanism A coverage gates | v7.8 (2026-05-04) | 2026-05-04 → 2026-05-11 (7d) | **already met** (calibration data sufficient) | [v7.8 bridge case study](../case-studies/framework-v7-8-bridge-case-study.md) |
| Mechanism C session-attribution gate | v7.8 (2026-05-04) | 2026-05-04 → 2026-05-11 (7d) | **already met** | [v7.8 bridge case study](../case-studies/framework-v7-8-bridge-case-study.md) |
| `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` (V2) | v7.8 (2026-05-04) | shipped enforced 2026-05-11 | **already enforced** (v7.8.3 Phase 0, PR [#298](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/298)) | v7.8.3 Phase 0 |
| Mechanism E custom merge driver (V9) | v7.8 (2026-05-04) | extended to feature logs 2026-05-11 | **already enforced** (v7.8.3 Phase 0) | v7.8.3 Phase 0 |
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL` cycle-time | v7.8.1 (2026-05-07) | indefinite (advisory by design) | **stays advisory** | T17 forward-only audit |
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_LAUNCHD_DRIFT` cycle-time | v7.8.1 (2026-05-07) | indefinite (advisory by design) | **stays advisory** | T18 macOS-only |
| `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` cycle-time mirror | v7.8.1 (2026-05-07) | indefinite (catches `--no-verify`) | **stays advisory** | T19 bypass-catcher |

### 2.2 Promotion Decision Criteria

The 2026-05-21 decision gate requires all four to be true for each candidate gate:

1. **Coverage emitted** — `gate-coverage.jsonl` shows ≥7 days of `{candidates, checked, skipped}` rows
2. **No false positives** — every `failure` row has a matching legitimate violation in the staged diff (operator review)
3. **No silent skips** — `skipped` count tracks real reasons (out-of-scope file paths, exempt feature tags), not bugs
4. **Reversibility** — if the flip causes regression, advisory mode can be restored in <5 min via single-line CLAUDE.md edit + hook header bump

If any criterion fails for a given gate, that gate stays advisory and re-evaluates at v7.10 (next promotion window, target ~2026-06-04, T+14d post-v7.9).

### 2.3 Side-effects of v7.9 promotion

- **CLAUDE.md** — Known Mechanical Limits section gains 2 enforced gate IDs + drops 2 from the "advisory" bullet list
- **Cold-start entrypoint** — new file `.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md` mirrors `framework-v7-8-3.md` with the flipped status
- **Dev-guide** — [`docs/architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md`](../architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md) §2.4 v7.8 bridge section gains "promoted" sub-section
- **Honesty ledger** — new entry FT2-FH-002 documenting the decision rationale + any deferrals
- **Linear** — new epic FIT-72 (or next) `v7.9-promotion`, sub-issues per flipped gate

### 2.4 v7.8.5 Pre-Promotion Remediation Patch (NEW, added 2026-05-12)

**Trigger:** PR #317 root-cause analysis surfaced 4 currently-failing tests in `test_gate_coverage.py::test_cache_hits_gate_records_*` all raising `KeyError: 'CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6'`. CLAUDE.md says v7.8.3 promoted this gate to `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT`. The tests' KeyError on the **old** name on origin/main suggests one of three possibilities:

1. **Rename incomplete** — the gate function was renamed but the coverage-instrumentation key (passed to `coverage.candidate(GATE)`) wasn't updated in lockstep. **Symptom:** Mechanism A emissions land under the wrong key (or under no key), corrupting the 2026-05-21 calibration data input.
2. **Test fixture rot only** — tests reference a constant that was deleted; gate emissions are fine. Symptom: tests fail but production telemetry is correct.
3. **Coverage instrumentation deleted entirely** — the rename was a hard cut; `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` records no Mechanism A telemetry at all. Symptom: gate-coverage.jsonl has zero entries for the gate; the 2026-05-21 decision has no quantitative input for this specific candidate.

**Why this MUST ship before 2026-05-21:** the entire promotion decision rests on `gate-coverage.jsonl` showing the gate fires correctly. If the gate's Mechanism A key is wrong, the data is keyed wrong, and the criterion #1 ("Coverage emitted") cannot be evaluated honestly. This is a meta-instance of the silent-pass class PR #317 fixed.

**Triage plan (v7.8.5, single PR, ~2 hours):**

1. **Read** `scripts/check-state-schema.py` for `check_cache_hits_*` function names + `coverage.candidate(...)` keys passed in.
2. **Read** `test_gate_coverage.py::test_cache_hits_gate_records_*` for what keys the tests expect.
3. **Read** `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` (last 7 days) — count entries by gate name. If `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` has zero entries, the rename was incomplete.
4. **Fix** the keying so emission ↔ test ↔ documentation all agree.
5. **Backfill** if telemetry was missed — re-run `make integrity-check` to populate the ledger with current state's coverage data so the 7-day window before 2026-05-21 starts clean.
6. **Add** a regression test that asserts the gate emits to `gate-coverage.jsonl` under the canonical key (Mechanism A check), preventing future rename-drift.

**Target ship:** 2026-05-13 → 2026-05-14 (T+7d remaining before 2026-05-21 = full window for the decision).

**Cross-references:** [`scripts/check-state-schema.py`](../../scripts/check-state-schema.py); [`scripts/tests/test_gate_coverage.py`](../../scripts/tests/test_gate_coverage.py); [PR #318](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/318) §"Pre-promotion remediation"; [v7.9 candidates spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-framework-v7-9-candidates.md) F18 pre-promotion remediation callout.

### 3.1 v7.9 Candidate Features (F-series) — Surfaced from Three Sources

**Source A — Roadmap stress-test (2026-05-07 session, [case study](../case-studies/roadmap-stress-test-2026-05-07-case-study.md) §99):**

| **F14** ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-05-22 → 05-23** | Test infrastructure | Per-gate `test_main_dispatch_<gate_id>()` requirement — every write-time gate must have ≥1 test driving `main()` end-to-end (Semgrep `rule.yml↔rule.test.yml` enforced-pairing pattern). 4 gates covered: `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT`, `CU_V2_INVALID`, `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK`, `CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS`. Shipped via PRs #451 (`86084c4`) + #452 (`3686f98`) + closure #455 (`98ca1ad7`). Layer-stacking constraint relaxed (see §3.6.2 below) — in-repo monkey-patch pattern from PR #317 proved sufficient without waiting on F16 try-repo harness. | Test discipline (write-time) | H (R=10 I=3 C=80% E=0.5w → 48.0) |

Shipped via same feature `framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` (joint scope). Combined coverage delta: write-time 1/16→8/16=50%; cycle-time 0/3→2/3=67%; total 1/19→10/19=53%.

Source: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-branch-isolation-out-of-scope.md). Each gated on its own re-evaluation trigger; default disposition is "not promoted to v8.0 unless trigger fires."

| ID | Item | cu_v2 | Re-eval trigger | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V8-I1** | Agent Smartlog UI — `/control-room/agents` live awareness + path-overlap detection | 2.2 (B_med) | ≥5 concurrent active features for 7+ days | Visibility layer; prevention is gated already |
| **V8-I2** | Op-log Replay — jj-style per-session rollback + GC | 2.9 (A_high) | ≥3 manual-cleanup incidents in 90d OR `git stash list` >5 for 30d | Recovery primitive; v7.8.3 `--no-verify` ledger is bridge |

### 3.3 v8.0 Docket Decision (2026-05-21 — T29 Phase 9 prioritization pass)

The 2026-05-21 prioritization pass at `framework-v7-8-branch-isolation` Phase 9 closure produces the final v8.0 docket by:

1. **Ranking** F1–F6 + F9–F18 + V8-I1 through V8-I7 (23 candidates after F7/F8 resolution) by RICE × 7-day telemetry signal strength
2. **Top-3-per-theme rule** (relaxed 2026-05-12 from prior "top-3 absolute") — pick top 3 by RICE within each theme so v8.0 covers breadth, not just the highest-RICE items. With 7 themes (A roadmap, B cross-repo asymmetry RESOLVED, C schema, D vocabulary, E ergonomics, F v7.8.3 cutover, G test discipline), v8.0 max docket = 18 items. Rest defer to v8.1.
3. **Companion case study** — Phase 9 produces `framework-v7-8-branch-isolation-case-study.md` with the prioritization decision recorded in Section 99 + ranked output to `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-v8-0-docket.md` (new file)
4. **Sub-experiment with hold-out** — if telemetry suggests *zero* F-items warrant promotion (rare but possible), v8.0 ships as a pure protocol patch and v8.x deferred to v8.1
5. **Test-discipline foundation precedence (added 2026-05-12)** — Theme G items (F14, F15, F16, F17, F18) have a dependency graph among themselves: F16 (try-repo harness) is foundation; F14 (per-gate dispatch tests) and F18 (mutation testing) depend on it; F15 is independent; F17 is independent. If ANY Theme G item enters v8.0, F16 MUST also enter v8.0 OR ship earlier as v7.9.1.

The Phase 9 task is tracked as **T29** in [`.claude/features/framework-v7-8-branch-isolation/state.json`](../../.claude/features/framework-v7-8-branch-isolation/state.json).

### 3.4 Theme distribution (after 2026-05-12 expansion)

| **H — Application-layer test coverage** (NEW 2026-05-13; see [`test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md)) | T1–T16 | 16 | iOS + web + backend + AI + analytics test discipline; T6 (Web PR gate) RICE 200; T14 (platform-parity field) RICE 160; full ranking at 2026-05-21 |
| **Icebox** | V8-I1 through V8-I7 | 7 | Each gated on own re-eval trigger |

## 3.5 Calibration Protocol for New Layers (NEW, added 2026-05-12)

The PR #317 incident + the cache_hits keying-drift suspicion (§2.4) both share the same root: **a new layer of framework infrastructure was added on top of an unmeasured prior layer.** Going forward, every new infrastructure layer must walk a 5-phase calibration protocol before becoming load-bearing.

### 3.5.1 The 5 Phases

```
Phase A — Specify         (before code is written)
Phase B — Ship advisory + measure   (T+0 → T+7d)
Phase C — Calibration gate          (T+7d → T+14d)
Phase D — Promotion decision        (T+14d)
Phase E — Post-promotion validation (T+14d → T+21d)
```

| Phase | Duration | Required artifacts | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Specify** | Pre-code | Gate spec (`function_name`, `emission_key`, dispatch site, expected skip reasons), 1 positive fixture, 1 negative fixture, regression test that asserts "this gate's `coverage.candidate(GATE)` fires when invoked under the expected input partition" | Spec + fixture + dispatch test ALL exist before any production code lands |
| **B — Ship advisory + measure** | 7 days minimum | Gate emits to `gate-coverage.jsonl` with `{candidates, checked, skipped, skip_reasons}`; PR ships with advisory-only mode (logs, doesn't block); operator checks Mechanism A at T+3d for unexpected skip_reasons | ≥7 days elapsed AND ≥1 real-world fire OR ≥3 documented legitimate skips |
| **C — Calibration gate** | 7 days | Quantitative: ≥N gate fires (N specified per gate, default N=5 for advisory→enforced; N=10 for novel mechanisms). Zero false positives confirmed by operator review of every `failure` row. All `skipped` rows match documented expected reasons. | All quantitative checks pass AND qualitative dogfood test runs cleanly |
| **D — Promotion decision** | 1 day | Decision recorded in case study + honesty ledger + CLAUDE.md update. Reversibility path tested (single-commit rollback rehearsed). | Either: flipped to enforced AND telemetry continues OR stays advisory AND re-evaluates at next T+14d cycle |
| **E — Post-promotion validation** | 7 days | Continuous telemetry monitoring; watch for false-positive incidents; trend analysis on fire frequency vs advisory baseline | 0 false-positive incidents in 7d → layer is "stable" and may have new layers built on top |

**Total minimum time per layer: 22 days** (Phase B 7d + Phase C 7d + Phase D 1d + Phase E 7d), with Phase A done up-front.

### 3.5.2 Layer Stacking Rule

**No new layer of framework infrastructure may be BUILT on top of a layer that hasn't reached Phase E.** This is the rule that codifies the PR #317 lesson — `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B was built (advisory) but never reached its own post-promotion validation; meanwhile we were already planning F11/F12/F13 on top of it.

Concrete application to F14–F18 (Theme G test discipline):

- F16 (try-repo harness) is foundation. It cannot ship until v7.9 promotion (~2026-05-21) clears Phase E (~2026-06-04 if successful).
- ~~F14 (per-gate dispatch tests) requires F16 in Phase E (so the harness exists). Earliest start: ~2026-06-04.~~ **CONSTRAINT RELAXED 2026-05-22:** F14 shipped without F16 by using the in-repo monkey-patch pattern proven in PR #317 (`monkeypatch.setattr(module, 'main', wrapped_main)` to invoke gates end-to-end without spawning a sub-repo). 9 dispatch tests across 4 surface files, 161/161 pytest pass, 0 contamination of canonical telemetry. F16 remains a v7.9.1+ candidate for the BROADER integration-test surface (full pre-commit pipeline including hook composition + git interaction), but it's no longer a blocker for per-gate dispatch coverage.
- F18 (mutation testing) requires F16 in Phase E AND F14 in Phase B (so there are tests to mutate). F14 is now in Phase E (shipped 2026-05-23), so F18 earliest-start drops to F16 ship + Phase E. ~~Earliest start: ~2026-06-11.~~ Now: ~~2026-06-11.~~ **Recomputed: F16 ship + 7d Phase E**; tentatively ~late June 2026.
- ~~F15 (zero-coverage gate unit tests) is independent — can start any time but should still walk Phases B–E.~~ **F15 SHIPPED 2026-05-22 → 05-23** as joint scope with F14 (both bundled into `framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` feature). All 5 zero-coverage gates (PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG, PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_TIMING, BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL, BRANCH_ISOLATION_LAUNCHD_DRIFT, PR_CACHE_STALE) now have ≥1 dispatch test.
- F17 (last_fired_at index) is independent — can start any time; minimal calibration needed since it's a read-only derived artifact.

### 3.5.3 Data Freshness Audit (quarterly)

Every 90 days, run an audit that asserts:

1. Each gate's `coverage.candidate(GATE)` emission key matches the gate's canonical function name (CLAUDE.md gate inventory).
2. Each gate has emitted ≥1 candidate to `gate-coverage.jsonl` in the last 30 days (using F17's `last_fired_at` index for O(1) lookup).
3. Each gate's `last_fired_at` is fresher than its introduction-date + advisory-window (else: silent-pass suspect).
4. Tests in `scripts/tests/` reference current canonical names (no `KeyError` on a renamed gate).

This audit is the meta-check that would have caught the cache_hits keying drift the moment it landed instead of weeks later via test failure. Initial run: 2026-08-12 (T+90d). Recurring: 2026-11-12, 2027-02-12, etc.

### 3.5.4 Reversibility Contract

Every gate must ship with a documented reversibility path:

- **Advisory rollback** — single-line edit to gate function returning early; no hook-header changes; rollback time <2 min.
- **Enforced rollback** — single-line edit to flip enforcement boolean OR hook-header bump from "enforced" to "advisory"; rollback time <5 min.
- **Mechanism rollback** — full mechanism (e.g., A, C, E) rollback requires reverting the original PR + a `chore/rollback-mechanism-<X>` PR; rollback time <30 min.

Rollback is rehearsed at Phase D (promotion decision) for every gate. Un-rehearsed rollback paths fail Phase D.

---

## 3.6 Forward Plan: v7.9 → v8.2 (NEW, added 2026-05-12)

Mapping all 23 open candidates to version slots. Each version has explicit calibration checkpoints from §3.5.

### 3.6.1 v7.8.5 — Pre-Promotion Remediation (target 2026-05-13 → 2026-05-14)

**Scope:** cache_hits keying drift investigation + fix (§2.4). Single PR. ~2 hours wall.

**Phase A artifacts** (must exist before fix is merged):
- Regression test asserting `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` emits to `gate-coverage.jsonl` under the canonical key on the next invocation
- Backfill of last 7 days of synthetic gate-coverage entries if the rename left a coverage hole (so the 2026-05-21 calibration window starts clean)

**Phases B–E:** N/A for this patch (no advisory window — it's a fix to an existing enforced gate, not a new layer).

**Why it ships at 7.8.5 not 7.9.0:** v7.9 is a *promotion* release, not a feature release. This is a fix that should ship under the patch-level cadence.

### 3.6.1.A v7.8.5 Observability Layer (SHIPPED 2026-05-13)

**Scope:** ship the **operator-facing observability layer** that closes a recurring debugging-friction gap. No new write-time or cycle-time gates; no telemetry impact on v7.9 calibration data.

**Two deliverables:**

1. **Observed Patterns Catalog** at [`.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md`](../../.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md) — 23 gate-firing patterns (write-time + cycle-time) + 9 workflow patterns (W1–W9) documented with trigger / why-expected / signal-vs-noise rule / silence path / first-observed. CLI: `make observed-patterns`. Auto-loaded as preflight by `/pm-workflow`. **Mandatory rule:** any novel pattern surfaced during a session MUST be appended before the protocol closes the feature. Shipped via [PR #328](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/328).

2. **W9 branch-drift real-time alert** at [`scripts/check-branch-drift.py`](../../scripts/check-branch-drift.py) — `PostToolUse:Bash` hook that records the current branch per session and emits a LOUD stderr warning on unexpected branch change (typically caused by another concurrent Claude session sharing the same git working directory running `git checkout`, flipping HEAD). Warning surfaced back to the assistant via tool output for real-time operator alerting. Includes a 4-step recovery playbook in the catalog. Disable: `CLAUDE_W9_DISABLE_DRIFT_CHECK=1`. Shipped via [PR #341](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/341).

**Why it ships at 7.8.5 not 7.9.0:** observability/documentation surfaces don't carry the framework-version semantics of gate additions. Patches don't affect the 22-day Calibration Protocol clock.

**v7.8.5 final mechanism inventory:** 33 mechanical gates + 5 advisories + **2 observability surfaces** (catalog + W9 hook). Effective `make integrity-check` baseline unchanged (0 findings + 4 expected advisories per pattern catalog).

### 3.6.2 v7.9 — Promotion Release (SHIPPED 2026-05-21 via PR #417 `ea53ff4`)

**Outcome (B1 freeze-day execution, 2026-05-21):** all 4 §2.2 promotion criteria met for all 3 candidate gates. Single-line flip at [`scripts/check-state-schema.py:132`](../../scripts/check-state-schema.py) (`BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = True → False`) drives all 3 gates simultaneously. **3 gates promoted, 0 rollbacks.**

| Gate | 14d telemetry (2026-05-07 → 2026-05-21) | candidates=0 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode B (infra commit-level) | 18 rows | 0 | PROMOTED |
| `BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION` Mode C (per-state.json mutation) | 13 rows | 0 | PROMOTED |
| `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` (write-time) | 13 rows | 0 | PROMOTED |
| `ISOLATION_OPT_OUT_REASON_MISSING` | 13 rows | 0 | (already enforced at v7.8.1 — no action) |

**First real-world gate fire confirmed same-session:** the v7.9 post-merge close-out commit triggered Mode C on first attempt (state.json declared `feature/v7-9-promotion` while operator was on `chore/v7-9-promotion-close-out`). Resolved via 1-line `branch` field update. Live demonstration that enforcement works. Captured in [FT2-FH-003 honesty ledger entry](../case-studies/framework-honesty-ledger.md#ft2-fh-003).

**Side-effects shipped same-PR (per §2.3):** CLAUDE.md "v7.9 Promotion Release" section + [`docs/architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md`](../architecture/dev-guide-v1-to-v7-7.md) §2.4.1 + [`.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md`](../../.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md) cold-start entrypoint + [FT2-FH-003 honesty ledger](../case-studies/framework-honesty-ledger.md) + [v7.9 case study](../case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md) + Linear epic FIT-72 In Progress + 9 sub-issues updated (FIT-78/79/80/81/84 Done, FIT-82/83 Canceled, FIT-85/86 In Progress).

**Case study:** [`docs/case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md`](../case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md) — live append-only journal; §99 synthesis deferred to 2026-05-28 post-B2 baseline snapshot.

**Phase E post-promotion validation runs 2026-05-21 → 2026-06-04 (LIVE):**

- No new gates ship
- No new test discipline work (F14, F18) starts
- Operator monitors `.claude/logs/gate-coverage.jsonl` for unexpected `failure` rows
- F17 (`last_fired_at` index) can be built in parallel since it's read-only — does not add new gates

**Original Scope** (preserved for historical reference): flip 6 currently-advisory mechanisms to enforced. **Actual scope at decision time:** 3 gates required action; 3 others were already enforced at v7.8/v7.8.3 (Mechanism A coverage + Mechanism C session-attribution + `CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT` V2 + Mechanism E V9). Scope narrowed via 2026-05-12 → 2026-05-21 patch-level work; no new measurement window required.

**Reversibility runbook:** single-line revert of `BRANCH_ISOLATION_ADVISORY_MODE = True` at [`scripts/check-state-schema.py:132`](../../scripts/check-state-schema.py) → commit + merge to main = <5min. Per [`.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md`](../../.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md) reversibility-runbook section.

### 3.6.3 v7.9.1 — Test Discipline Foundation + Low-Effort Wins (target 2026-06-04 → 2026-06-11)

**Scope:** ship the lowest-friction items that DON'T require waiting for v8.0 docket prioritization. All are non-gate-additive (no new gates) or telemetry-only.

| Item | Phase A status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F16** — try-repo harness | Spec ready in PR #318 + §3.6.4 below | 0.5w | Foundation for F14 + F18 |
| **F17** — `last_fired_at` index | Spec at v7.9 candidates §2 F17 | 0.3w | Read-only derived artifact, no advisory window |
| **F2** — Phase 0 reality-check sub-step | Spec at v7.9 candidates §2 F2 | 0.3w | Workflow-only, no gate code |
| **F6** — B_medium tier doc | CLAUDE.md edit only | 0.1w | Doc-only |
| **D-2** — Configure GA4 conversions (`workout_complete` + `nutrition_meal_logged`) | Spec in [analytics decisions log §13](analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md) | 5 min | 🟡 yellow per analytics MP §7.5 — defer until 2026-06-04 to avoid contaminating v7.9 calibration. GA4 UI toggle; verify via `mcp__ga4__runReport` with `isConversionEvent` dim. Surfaced by FIT-142 closure 2026-05-17 (PR [#388](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/388)) |
| **D-4** — Delete old `com.regevba.FitTracker` Firebase iOS app entry | Spec in [analytics decisions log §13](analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md) | 1 min | 🟢 green per analytics MP §7.5 — pure cleanup, no telemetry shape change. Operator-only Firebase Console click. Surfaced by FIT-142 closure 2026-05-17 (PR [#388](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/388)) |

**Calibration windows:** F16 + F17 walk B–E since they're new infrastructure. F2 + F6 are workflow/doc changes (single-commit reversible) and skip B–C; ship directly with `verify-local` validation. D-2 + D-4 are operator-side surface changes (no code) and ride the v7.9.1 window only because they're scoped + cheap; D-4 could ship anytime post-v7.9 (green class) but is batched with D-2 to amortize the Firebase-Console operator cost.

**D-3 (screen-view tracking gap) note:** also surfaced by FIT-142 closure but excluded from v7.9.1 because it's iOS code work (1-2h) with new event volume → tracked as analytics-observability v8 docket candidate **F21**. See [analytics master plan §5.6](analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md#56-phase-1a-bis--screen-view-tracking-gap-deferred-to-v791-or-v80) (to be added) + state.json task D-3.

### 3.6.4 v8.0 — Top-Per-Theme Docket (target 2026-06-18 → 2026-07-31)

**Scope:** top 3 per theme by RICE × telemetry signal strength, picked at 2026-05-21 Phase 9 prioritization. Maximum docket = 18 items; realistic docket = 6–10 items per the historical v7.x cadence.

**Theme G test discipline precedence:** F14 + F18 only ship if F16 is in Phase E (post-validation stable) by ~2026-06-11 per the layer stacking rule (§3.5.2). If F16 slips, F14 + F18 also slip.

**Expected v8.0 docket composition (provisional, decided 2026-05-21):**

| Likely-in | Likely-defer-to-v8.1 |
|---|---|
| F1 (STATE_TASKS_FILESYSTEM_DRIFT) — Theme A top | F3 — workflow gate, lower telemetry pull |
| F4 (framework_version auto-update) — Theme C top | F5 — vocabulary, ergonomics-only |
| F10 (experiment_outcome enum) — Theme C #2 | F9 — make complete-feature, depends on F14/F18 |
| F11 (BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL allowlist) — Theme F top | F12 (actionlint) — could ship v7.9.1 if it scores highest at 2026-05-21 |
| F14 (per-gate dispatch tests) — Theme G #2 (if F16 stable) | F13 — workflow_dispatch input |
| F15 (zero-coverage gate unit tests) — Theme G #3 | F18 (mutation testing) — depends on F14 + F16 |
| **F19** (CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT) — Theme G #4 (RICE 80.0; added 2026-05-13 via [analytics-master-plan §11](analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md#11-v79-candidate-mapping-f19--f20)) | — |
| **F20** (GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED advisory) — Theme G #5 (RICE 30.0; added 2026-05-13) | — |

**Calibration:** every v8.0 item walks Phases B–E independently. v8.0 ships as a *cumulative release* — items merge to main as each individually completes Phase E.

### 3.6.5 v8.1 — Deferred F-items + First Icebox Triggers (target 2026-08 → 2026-09)

**Scope:** items deferred from v8.0 + any V8-I icebox item whose re-eval trigger fired.

**Likely V8-I triggers by ~2026-08:**
- **V8-I1** (Agent Smartlog UI) — trigger is ≥5 concurrent active features for 7+ days. Phase 2-bis + Track 6 + v8.0 builds may push concurrent count to that threshold; check at 2026-07-31.
- **V8-I2** (Op-log Replay) — trigger is ≥3 manual-cleanup incidents in 90d OR `git stash list` >5 for 30d. Currently 2 stashes on canonical (stress-test pre-skill + import-training-plan-resume); monitor.

**Likely V8-I non-triggers by ~2026-08 (defer to v8.2 or later):**
- V8-I3 (Vercel Sandbox / Firecracker microVM) — no untrusted-code use case in the queue
- V8-I4 (FS kernel sandboxing) — no regulatory mandate
- V8-I5 (inotify/fsevents broadcast mediator) — no concurrent-write incidents tracked
- V8-I6 (Cross-feature dependency analysis) — `path-reducers.json` has <5 entries; threshold is ≥20
- V8-I7 (Auto-rollback on kill-criteria fire) — needs F1 (STATE_TASKS_FILESYSTEM_DRIFT) telemetry first

### 3.6.6 v8.2+ — Long Tail (target Q4 2026 → 2027)

**Scope:** remaining V8-I icebox items whose re-eval triggers haven't fired + new candidates surfaced from v8.0/v8.1 dogfood.

**Note:** the framework explicitly does NOT pre-commit to v8.2+ contents. Per Phase E (post-promotion validation), each release writes its own docket only after the previous release stabilizes.

### 3.6.6.A Analytics Observability Sub-doc (added 2026-05-13)

Concurrent product-tier feature `analytics-observability` opened 2026-05-13 ships across the v7.9 + v7.9.1 + v8.0 windows as a sub-doc of this plan. Full spec at [`analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md); decisions trail at [`analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md`](analytics-observability-decisions-log-2026-05-13.md).

**Calibration alignment with this plan:**

| Analytics phase | Date window | Calibration phase | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1.A (hygiene) | 2026-05-15 → 22 | N/A (non-gate) | Backfill 56 CSV rows + wire 4 events + 21 tests |
| Phase 2 (debugger) | 2026-05-15 → 22 (parallel 1.A) | N/A (non-gate) | Local mirror + GA4 Realtime MCP poll |
| Phase 3 (dashboards) | 2026-05-21 → 06-04 (parallel **v7.9 Phase E**) | N/A (non-gate) | `/control-room/analytics` route + Looker template; honors Phase E "no new gates" rule |
| Phase 1.B (gates) | 2026-06-04 → 06-26 | Full A→B→C→D→E 22d | 2 new gates: `CSV_TAXONOMY_DRIFT` (F19) + `GA4_MCP_DISCONNECTED` (F20); ship advisory 06-04, enforced earliest 06-18, Phase E exit 06-25 |

**Why this fits this plan:** the analytics work consumes Mechanism A coverage telemetry, F16 try-repo harness (ride-on, not blocker), v7.8.2 cross-repo asymmetry policy (FT2-only Mechanism A), v7.8.3 D-1 reverse-sync (CSV mirror to fitme-story build), and v8.x docket Theme G test discipline. Treating it as a separate parallel track would duplicate those interfaces; Approach A (sub-doc) keeps the forward-looking roadmap single-source.

**F19 + F20 added to §3.6.4 v8.0 docket Theme G** (see updated table below).

### 3.6.6.C fitme-story Discoverability Sub-doc (added 2026-05-20; cross-ref backfilled 2026-05-24 per D-PLAN-3)

Companion plan at [`fitme-story-discoverability-plan-2026-05-20.md`](fitme-story-discoverability-plan-2026-05-20.md) addressing the discoverability gap surfaced 2026-05-20: `fitme-story.vercel.app` was production-live with the v7.9 promotion case study but receiving 0 measurable web traffic. 4-phase plan (Foundation SEO → Crosslinking → Promotion → Measure+Iterate) with phased calendar 2026-05-21 → 2026-06-30 + kill criterion ("if <10 weekly visitors by 2026-06-30, pivot").

**Phase E safe** — Phases 1-3 are all UI/content/redirect work (no infra-path commits). Phase 4 measure window overlaps Phase E end (2026-06-04) but doesn't conflict (analytics-observability Phase 3.B wiring is independent of the v7.9 promotion gate calibration).

**Current status** (2026-05-24):

- Phase 1 (Foundation, code-side): **CODE COMPLETE** — P1.3 OpenGraph + Twitter Card meta + P1.4 OG image generator shipped 2026-05-21 (`src/app/layout.tsx` + `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx`). Operator-only items (P1.1 Search Console DNS + P1.2 sitemap + P1.5 GA Realtime verify) pending.
- Phase 2 (Crosslinking): **PARTIAL** — P2.1 FT2 README link shipped 2026-05-24 (PR #465); P2.2 fitme-story README link already present pre-plan; P2.3 dashboard 301 redirect + path preservation shipped 2026-05-24 (PR #467); P2.4 obviated by P2.3.
- Phase 3 (Promotion): operator content work (LinkedIn / HN Show / dev.to crossposts).
- Phase 4 (Measure + Iterate): 2026-06-04+ depends on analytics-observability Phase 3.B (E-4 in post-v7-9 candidate plan).

**Why this fits this plan:** discoverability is an operational follow-through on the v7.9 promotion case study (the same content the framework page surfaces). Treating it as standalone disconnects the SEO + crosslink lift from the strategic narrative the framework dev-guide + case studies tell. Cross-referencing here ties the sub-doc into the §3.6 forward plan.

### 3.6.6.B Cross-Layer Test Coverage Sub-doc (added 2026-05-13)

Concurrent test-discipline audit on 2026-05-13 surfaced that Theme G covers framework-layer tests only. The other five system layers (iOS, web, backend, AI, analytics) are under-spec'd or in some places zero-tested. Full audit + 16 T-candidates spec'd at [`test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md).

**Headline gaps surfaced (4-agent audit):**

| Layer | Tests inventoried | Top gap |
|---|---|---|
| Framework (Python) | 133 methods / 13 files; ~30% gate coverage | cache_hits keying drift (v7.8.5 blocker — already on docket §2.4) |
| iOS (Swift) | 549 methods / 56 files | Sentry zero tests; SignInService passkey/WebAuthn zero tests; ~130-file View layer untested |
| Web (fitme-story) | 122 cases / 17 files | **Zero JS tests run on PR**; 119 React components + 27 routes untested; WebAuthn route handlers untested |
| Backend | 248 Swift methods / 22 files | SignInService zero coverage; multi-device reconciliation + key-rotation + sync cascades untested |
| AI | 75 methods / 5 files | **Zero LLM behavioral evals**; cohort prior has 3 tests; `phase2bis-prompt-set.json` has no harness |
| Analytics | 147 methods / 11 files; 81% event-count coverage | No runtime emission audit (events fired in app match CSV); ~40% parameter-combination coverage |

**T-candidate docket (Theme H) feeds 2026-05-21 prioritization pass alongside F-candidates.** Top-5 by RICE:

1. **T6** — Web PR test gate (RICE **200.0**; ~1h effort; v7.9.1 ride-along candidate or earlier)
2. **T14** — Platform-parity state.json field `platforms_tested: {ios, web, backend, ai}` (RICE **160.0**; extends FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS; ~1–2h)
3. ~~**T2** — Sentry integration test pass~~ ⏸ **DEFERRED to App Store launch** (Sentry integration stack paused 2026-05-21; TestFlight ≠ real-user signal; cadence §C3 deferral closed 2026-05-23). RICE **80.0**; will reopen when launch is scheduled.
4. **T13** — `last_fired_at` extension to all gates (RICE **80.0**; depends on F17 in Phase E)
5. **T1** — Per-gate dispatch test enforcement gate `GATE_TEST_MISSING` (RICE **53.3**; depends on F14 in Phase E; closes the drift class behind cache_hits keying)

**External pattern sources** (10 systems researched; 7 patterns borrowed): Next.js test stratification, AWS Config `LastSuccessfulInvocationTime`, Stripe/GitHub `oasdiff`, Linear/Lyft platform-parity, pre-commit `try-repo` + `stages:`, Semgrep rule-test pairing, promptfoo + Anthropic golden-set LLM evals, uber/pointfreeco Swift snapshot testing, ArchDrift + shipmonk orphan-test detection. Overkill-and-rejected: Pact broker, Next.js isolated-installation-per-test, Airbnb 30K-snapshot scale, Muter Swift mutation testing.

**Calibration alignment:** all T-candidates walk the same Phase A→E protocol (§3.5). T-candidates with effort ≤ XS that extend an already-enforced gate (T14, T16) may skip Phases B–C. The sub-doc also proposes a quarterly cross-layer test audit (sub-doc §6.2) recurring at T+90d (first run 2026-08-13), mirroring §3.5.3 Data Freshness Audit but covering application-layer tests.

**Why this fits this plan:** the sub-doc consumes the same calibration protocol, the same RICE convention, the same gate-coverage telemetry, and the same 2026-05-21 prioritization pass. Treating Theme H as a separate plan would duplicate those interfaces; sub-doc keeps the forward-looking roadmap single-source.

### 3.6.7 Cumulative Mechanism Inventory by Version (projected)

| Version | Mechanical gates | Advisory | Mechanisms (A–F) | Test discipline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v7.8.4 (current) | 34 | 5 | A, C, D, F advisory; B, E enforced | None | shipped |
| v7.8.5 | 34 | 5 | same | None (fix only) | target 2026-05-14 |
| v7.9 | 34 | 3 | A, C → enforced; D, F stay advisory | None | target 2026-05-21 |
| v7.9.1 | 34 | 3 | same | F16 advisory; F17 enforced (read-only) | target 2026-06-11 |
| v8.0 | 37–39 | 4–6 | same + new gates per docket | F14 advisory; F15 enforced; F16 enforced | target 2026-07-31 |
| v8.1 | 40–43 | 4–6 | + deferred items | F18 advisory → enforced | target 2026-09 |

### 3.8 External Audit Substrate

The 4 External Audits + 4 quarterly Data Freshness Audits booked in §5 run through a single substrate: `docs/audits/prompts/01-extraction-prompt.md` (operator-side) + `docs/audits/prompts/02-auditor-prompt.md` (fresh-chat auditor) + `scripts/audit/build_bundle.py` (deterministic, redacted bundle generator). Profile JSON files at `scripts/audit/profiles/*.json` parameterize the substrate per audit date — same prompts, different file set. Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-impartial-audit-prompt-substrate-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-impartial-audit-prompt-substrate-design.md).

This addresses unclosable-gap #5 (Tier 3.3 external replication — see §6.1).

## 4. HADF Phase 2-bis — Active Research Build (Special Status)

HADF Phase 2-bis is the only infra-adjacent build *currently in flight* on the main branch. It's a research-tier feature whose 5 phases of cross-repo sync infrastructure dependencies are met by v7.8.3.

### 4.1 Status

- **Branch:** `feat/hadf-phase2bis-spec` (current branch as of session open)
- **Open PR:** [FT2 #306](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/pull/306) — finalized design spec
- **Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-hadf-phase2bis-replication-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-hadf-phase2bis-replication-design.md) — 2,919 words / 14 sections after R1–R8 audit revisions
- **Phase:** Spec complete (Phase 1 of /pm-workflow). Awaiting user review on PR #306, then writing-plans → tasks → implementation.

### 4.2 Infra Dependencies (all MET by v7.8.3)

| Dependency | v7.8.3 deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `state_owner` schema with STATE_OWNER_* gates | Phase 2 of v7.8.3 | ✅ MET 2026-05-11 |
| V2 (`CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT`) enforced | Phase 0 of v7.8.3 | ✅ MET 2026-05-11 |
| V9 (Mechanism E driver) covers `.claude/logs/<feature>.log.json` | Phase 0 of v7.8.3 | ✅ MET 2026-05-11 |
| `make snapshot-phase` for per-phase backups | Phase 0 of v7.8.3 | ✅ MET 2026-05-11 |
| `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS` enforced via Phase 4 cutover protocol | v7.8.1 (advisory) → v7.8.3 cutover protocol | ✅ MET 2026-05-11 |

### 4.3 Sub-Experiment Timeline (15 days wall-clock, ~$5 total)

| Window | Sub-experiment | Description | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2026-05-23 → ~2026-05-26** | Sub-exp 1 | Cloud generalization + halfway routing test (9 endpoints, 6 providers) | ~$3–4 |
| → kill-criteria check → verdict | | | |
| **~2026-05-27 → ~2026-05-30** | Sub-exp 2 | Cloud-vs-local separability (Ollama on M2, 1 endpoint) | $0 |
| → kill-criteria check → verdict | | | |
| **~2026-05-31 → ~2026-06-03** | Sub-exp 3 | Decisive same-model routing test (AWS Bedrock haiku vs Anthropic direct, 3 endpoints) | ~$1 |
| → anchor-drift trip-wire → verdict | | | |
| **~2026-06-07** | Cross-synthesis | Cross-sub-exp synthesis case study published | — |

### 4.4 Pre-Launch Gate

Sub-experiment 1 cannot start until **all 4 mandatory architectural fixes** + **3 pre-registration JSON files** + **6-item pre-experiment safety verification ceremony** complete. Spec §6–§10 enumerate.

### 4.5 Downstream Unblock

Once Sub-experiment 3 verdict lands (~2026-06-03), the deferred **Track 6 HADF gate activation** Feature becomes eligible to start. That Feature was explicitly Q3=OUT of Phase 2-bis scope; it's a separate Feature lifecycle.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 6.1 Mechanically Unclosable Gaps (carried forward from v7.6)

Recorded authoritatively in [`docs/case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md`](../case-studies/meta-analysis/unclosable-gaps.md). v7.8.3 did not change this list:

1. ~~`cache_hits[]` writer-path adoption~~ — **CLOSED in v7.8.3 (V2 enforced)**
2. `cu_v2` factor *correctness* — judgment-based; presence-checked only
3. T1/T2/T3 tier-tag *correctness* — presence-checked, not value-checked
4. Tier 2.1 real-provider auth checklist — requires human-at-simulator
5. Tier 3.3 external replication — requires external operator ([GitHub issue #142](https://github.com/Regevba/FitTracker2/issues/142))

### 6.2 Cross-Repo Asymmetry (codified v7.8.2)

v7.8.2 documented that fitme-story does NOT get full FT2 gate parity. The asymmetry is intentional:

- FT2 = canonical state.json owner for product features + framework state
- fitme-story = state_owner for fitme-story-native features only (3d-interactive-framework-flow-diagram is the first)
- Mechanism A `gate-coverage.jsonl` emits in FT2 only; cross-repo aggregator (`gate-coverage-aggregator.ts`) reads both streams into the control-room UI

Re-eval annual (next 2027-05-08) or earlier if 3 signals fire. Full spec: [2026-05-08-cross-repo-gate-asymmetry.md](../superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-cross-repo-gate-asymmetry.md).

### 6.3 Concurrent Dispatch Hygiene

Parallel subagent dispatch remains **blocked at the framework layer** (F6–F9 from audit-v2 stress test). Serial dispatch is the working pattern until upstream patches land. Re-validation gate documented at [`docs/superpowers/plans/f6-f9-reproducer/proof-of-fix-tests.md`](../superpowers/plans/f6-f9-reproducer/proof-of-fix-tests.md). No v7.9 / v8.0 work depends on parallel dispatch.

### 6.4 v7.8 Mechanisms A–F — Promotion Decoupling

The six v7.8 bridge mechanisms (A coverage gates, B schema dual-read, C session attribution, D self-audit, E merge driver, F membrane status) ship/promote independently:

| Mechanism | Status as of 2026-05-12 |
|---|---|
| **A** — coverage gates | Advisory; 2026-05-21 promotion-eligible |
| **B** — schema field-rename dual-read | Already canonical (46/46 features migrated `created` → `created_at` in v7.8 PR-2) |
| **C** — PostToolUse:Read hook + session attribution | Advisory; 2026-05-21 promotion-eligible |
| **D** — pre-commit header self-audit | Advisory; stays advisory (low signal) |
| **E** — custom git merge driver | Enforced 2026-05-11 (extended to feature logs in v7.8.3) |
| **F** — membrane status advisory | Stays advisory (operator readout, not gate) |

---

## 7. Risk Register (infra-only)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **cache_hits keying drift corrupts 2026-05-21 calibration data** (added 2026-05-12) | Medium | High (promotion decision keyed wrong) | v7.8.5 patch ships 2026-05-13 → 14 per §2.4; full audit of gate emission ↔ function name ↔ test name alignment; regression test asserts canonical key emission |
| 2026-05-21 promotion fails on insufficient telemetry | Low | Medium | Stays advisory + re-evaluates 2026-06-04 (T+14d) |
| HADF Phase 2-bis Sub-exp 1 kill-criteria fire | Medium | High (research-track halt) | Pre-registered kill criteria + 3 independent sub-experiments; failure of one does not invalidate the others |
| F12 (actionlint) ships but catches a real CI YAML error mid-promotion week | Low | Low | Pre-commit gate fires locally before push; CI side already covered by GH Actions runtime validation |
| v8.0 prioritization pass produces an empty docket | Low | Low | v8.0 ships as protocol patch; v8.1 inherits the F-series + icebox |
| DevSSD disconnect during 2026-05-21 or 2026-05-23 windows | Medium (hardware open) | High | Pre-window: ensure backup + `pmset disksleep 0`; tracked separately in [project_devssd_disconnect_remediation_2026_05_02.md](~/.claude/projects/-Volumes-DevSSD-FitTracker2/memory/project_devssd_disconnect_remediation_2026_05_02.md) |
| Cross-repo sync workflow regression on first non-FT2 fitme-story-native feature | Medium | Medium | F11 (BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL allowlist) ships in v8.0 — interim manual reconciliation if regression hits 2026-05-12 → 2026-05-21 |
| **Test discipline debt blocks v8.0 docket** (added 2026-05-12) | Medium | Medium | §3.5.2 layer stacking rule requires F16 (try-repo harness) at Phase E before F14 or F18 ships. If F16 slips, drop F14+F18 from v8.0 docket; don't pile on debt. |
| **Mutation testing CI cost overrun on F18 promotion** (added 2026-05-12) | Low | Low | Phase B calibration measures actual `mutmut` runtime on hosted runner; if >15min/run, scope further before flipping enforced. Defer rather than slow CI. |
| **Phase A specification rot** — gate spec exists but no fixture written, so Phase B coverage is theoretical (added 2026-05-12) | Medium | Medium | §3.5.1 Phase A exit criteria require BOTH spec AND fixture AND dispatch test. PR template + reviewer checklist added. |

## 8. Open Questions

1. **v7.9 cadence going forward** — Is the T+14d advisory→enforced cadence the durable rule, or should it widen to T+21d once the framework stops accumulating new gates? §3.5 codifies T+22d as the per-layer minimum (Phase B 7d + Phase C 7d + Phase D 1d + Phase E 7d) — should the project-wide cadence widen to match? Decide at 2026-05-21.
2. **F12 (actionlint) priority placement** — RICE-est is 100.0 (highest in F-series). Should it ship *outside* the v8.0 docket as a v7.9.1 patch, or wait for v8.0? §3.6.3 currently does NOT include F12 in v7.9.1 because actionlint is gate-additive (new pre-commit check) — would require full Phase B–E walk. Decide at 2026-05-21.
3. **v8.0 vs v8.1 split** — Top-per-theme rule (§3.3) may force F-items vs icebox items into the same shortlist. Tie-breaker: prefer F-items (already spec'd) over icebox (specs pending). Confirm at prioritization pass.
4. **HADF gate activation as separate Feature vs v8.0 entry** — Track 6 is explicitly separate at ~2026-06-07 launch. Should it carry its own framework version bump (v8.x = HADF gate)? Decide at Phase 2-bis Phase 9 close.
5. **(NEW 2026-05-12) v7.8.5 ship timing** — Can v7.8.5 (cache_hits keying remediation) ship 2026-05-13 OR 2026-05-14? If delayed past 2026-05-14, the gate's calibration window shrinks below 7d and that specific gate must defer to v7.10. Triage urgency on 2026-05-13 morning.
6. **(NEW 2026-05-12) F16 sequencing — ship at v7.9.1 OR bundle with v8.0?** §3.6.3 puts F16 in v7.9.1 as foundation for F14 + F18. Argument for earlier ship: harness IS the calibration tool — lets us validate F14's per-gate dispatch tests catch dispatcher bugs. Argument for bundling with v8.0: keeps v7.9 promotion atomic + reduces Phase D cycles. Decide at 2026-05-21.
7. **(NEW 2026-05-12) Phase A enforcement** — should Phase A artifacts (spec + fixture + dispatch test) be enforced via a new pre-commit gate (`GATE_SPEC_INCOMPLETE`) OR via PR-review checklist only? Mechanical enforcement matches v7.8.1 spirit; checklist-only matches v7.8.4 humility about what can be mechanically checked. Decide at 2026-06-04 v7.9.1 build start.

All 4 §2.2 criteria GREEN. Side-effects: CLAUDE.md v7.9 section + dev-guide §2.4.1 + [`.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md`](../../.claude/entrypoints/framework-v7-9.md) + [FT2-FH-003 honesty ledger](../case-studies/framework-honesty-ledger.md#ft2-fh-003) + [`docs/case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md`](../case-studies/framework-v7-9-promotion-case-study.md) + Linear FIT-72 In Progress + 9 sub-issues updated. **First real-world Mode C gate fire** caught + resolved (state.json::branch update). Day shipped 4 PRs: #413 (`e05eb32`) + #415 (`424963f`) + #416 (`0178a9c`) + #417 (`ea53ff4`) + close-out #419 (`9bfb7bb`). **Sentry pause** documented (PR #418) — pre-launch trigger because iOS app is TestFlight-beta only. §3.6.2 updated with SHIPPED outcome. Phase E live 2026-05-21 → 2026-06-04. |
| 2026-05-22 | **Phase E day 1: post-promotion calibration sweep + plan refresh.** Full data-integrity + telemetry sweep `make integrity-check` returned **0 findings + 0 advisory** post-PR #442 (advisory-clear backfill: cache_hits[] + T2 tier-tag on UCC hardening case study). §0 TL;DR refreshed to reflect v7.9 SHIPPED state. §3.1 expanded with **Source E** (5 candidates from post-v7.9 plan): F19 (analytics-observability Phase 1.B GA4 conversions, v7.9.1) + F20 (Firebase event-name cleanup, v7.9.1) + ~~F21~~ (Sentry — PAUSED pre-launch) + F22 (Funnel Analysis Dashboards, post-Phase-E) + F23 (`/ops digest` skill). MEMORY.md stale "Latest" marker on 2026-05-20 row removed; v7.9 promotion entry updated to reflect all 4 PRs merged. `fitme-story-public-enhancements` T13 reconciled in state.json (shipped 2026-05-21 via fitme-story PR #129 `ad65d98`; 24/24 tasks done). Phase E day 1 telemetry healthy (Mechanism A 16 distinct gates emitting; 273 events total). |

| 2026-05-24 (later) | **Dev-env + UI/UX sub-plans codified (4th + 5th sub-docs) via PR #472 (MERGED `5542327`).** Two new sub-plans registered under §9 References: (a) [`dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md`](dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md) promotes the 2026-05-19 research-grade dev-env audit to a tracked plan with R1–R24 status matrix (6/24 shipped — R1+R2+R3+R4+R5+R6 verified via fs ground-truth sweep); R-items are Chore-cadence and do NOT compete for v7.9.1 / v8.x F-series slots; 18 open R-items mirrored as `docs/product/backlog.md` §"Dev-Env Stability & Scale Track". (b) [`ui-ux-master-plan-2026-05-24.md`](ui-ux-master-plan-2026-05-24.md) covers UI/UX work across both surfaces (26 shipped + 9 in-flight + ~23 open); surfaces 5 drift / reconciliation items (UX-R1 through UX-R5); open items mirrored as backlog §"UI/UX Track". Same session: **UX-R1** state.json reconciliation of `fitme-story-public-enhancements` `phase=implementation → complete` with Q6 PR-list parity backfill (T13 pr#129 → 134 + related_prs added to T7/T8/T15/T17/T21 + `pr_citation_exempt` for #75/#129) + Tier 2.2 phase_transition log; **UX-R2** verified `ai-recommendation-ui` `parent_case_study` link satisfies `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK`; **UX-R3** new `docs/design-system/design-rules.md` codifying AI-avatar = brand-icon rule; **UX-R4** new `docs/case-studies/pm-flow-orbital-iteration-case-study.md` for orbital rollback iteration log; **UX-R5** Failure Recognition Layer filed Aspirational/v8.x candidate; **B3** daily GA4 anomaly check executed (no anomalies; 2026-05-21 119-screen-view spike correlates with v7.9 ship date, not real user signal). Integrity baseline preserved 0+0 throughout. Dev-guide v7.9 readability pass + ledger updates shipped via follow-up PRs #144 + #473 (both MERGED). |
| 2026-05-24 (afternoon-2) | **Phase E day 3 (continued): 3 PRs merged today + A+B hygiene batch.** PR #144 (fitme-story: dev-guide v7.9 readability pass + /framework card v7.9 bump; 2 files +124 / -66) MERGED. PR #473 (FT2: dev-guide v7.9 readability pass on top of PR #464's banner — TL;DR + Glossary + §15 scannable checklist + §15A → §16 promotion + §16 References → §17 renumber; 1 file +137 / -102 across 2 commits) MERGED. **Drift parity now correct:** both FT2 + fitme-story dev-guide H1 read `(v1.0 → v7.9)`. **Empirical Mode B finding:** small chore-branch commits to `docs/architecture/*` pass pre-commit without `--no-verify` — earlier session conservatism around isolated-worktree-required for that path was over-cautious. **A-batch hygiene shipped via PR #474:** A1 PHASE_LIE fix on `framework-f14-f15-dispatch-test-coverage` (documentation sub-phase `in_progress` → `complete`); A2 tracking-drift-check meta-finding promoted to backlog (4/6 items in today's plan turned out to be already-shipped-but-untracked: R6 + UU1 + UU2 + C5 — pattern worth a future `make tracking-drift-check`); A4 daily-checkpoint reality check (cron firing into `.jsonl` cleanly; `.md` table lag noted — W11.b again, not blocking); B1 companion-doc readability pass on `docs/architecture/feature-lifecycle-event-catalog.md` (§0 90-sec tour + §0.5 Glossary, 17 terms); B3 audit substrate dry-run succeeded (sha `52fffa1e...`). Phase E telemetry healthy. |
