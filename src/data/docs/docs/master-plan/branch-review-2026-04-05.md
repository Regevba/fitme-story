## Branch Health Summary

### Safe to Delete (9 branches — fully merged or subsumed)

| Branch | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `ci-check-test` | Stale predecessor; work re-merged via later PRs |
| `fix/phase4-ios-auth-security` | Squash-merged to main as `85743c3` |
| `fix/phase5-ios-stability` | Squash-merged to main as `85743c3` |
| `origin/claude/continue-execution-bJN3i` | Subset of `feat/design-system-v2` |
| `origin/claude/master-plan-rice-prioritization` | Merged as PR #19 |
| `origin/claude/simulator-workaround-and-token-cleanup` | Merged as PR #18 |
| `origin/pm-workflow-skill` | Merged to main |
| `origin/feature/development-dashboard` | Fully merged |
| `origin/phase-0/foundation-docs` | Merged as `1fca377` |

### Active/Unmerged — Need Decisions (6 branches)

| Branch | Unique Commits | Content | Action Needed |
|--------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| `feature/google-analytics` | 9 | Analytics infrastructure, 23 tests, Firebase wiring | **MERGE FIRST** — clean base on main |
| `claude/investigate-ci-failure-xP9kS` | 73 | Skills ecosystem v2.0 + CI fixes — BUT 20 commits behind main | **REBASE then merge** |
| `feat/design-system-v2` | 33 | Advanced DS phases, Figma MCP automation, CI lint gate | **Review** — overlaps with MCP branch |
| `claude/implement-mcp-server-AVtFa` | 41 | Iteration 2 design revisions, final token migration | **Review** — most current DS working branch |
| `origin/feature/gdpr-compliance` | 24 | Full GDPR feature: delete account + data export | **Active feature** — merge after analytics |
| `origin/feature/marketing-website` | 30 | Astro marketing site + Android DS token mapping | **Active feature** — merge after analytics |

### `codex/ui-integration` — DOES NOT EXIST

The branch referenced in the resume handoff doc no longer exists on any remote. The UI integration work was independently absorbed into `claude/investigate-ci-failure-xP9kS` via squash merge and into `feat/design-system-v2`. **Not a blocker** — the work lives elsewhere.

## Merge Conflict Analysis

### Critical: `feature/google-analytics` vs `claude/investigate-ci-failure-xP9kS`

**5 files overlap — manual merge required if not sequenced correctly:**

| File | Conflict Severity | Details |
|------|:-----------------:|---------|
| `FitTrackerApp.swift` | **HIGH** | Both modify `init()` and `rootView` body. Analytics adds Firebase init + consent gate. CI branch adds review mode + ColorContrastValidator. |
| `.claude/skills/pm-workflow/SKILL.md` | **HIGH** | Completely divergent versions (CI branch = v2.0 rewrite, analytics = v1.2 additions) |
| `SettingsView.swift` | **HIGH** | CI branch does massive DS rewrite (1,239 lines). Analytics adds toggle section. |
| `RootTabView.swift` | **MEDIUM** | Different sections modified (DS tokens vs analytics screen modifiers) |
| `NutritionView.swift` | **MEDIUM** | Different sections (restructured layout vs one `.analyticsScreen()` modifier) |

### Recommended Merge Order

```
1. feature/google-analytics → main        (clean merge, based on current main)
2. Rebase claude/investigate-ci-failure-xP9kS onto new main
3. Cherry-pick or merge skills ecosystem + CI fixes only (drop duplicate DS work)
4. feature/gdpr-compliance → main          (after analytics)
5. feature/marketing-website → main        (after analytics)
6. Resolve feat/design-system-v2 vs claude/implement-mcp-server-AVtFa (consolidate)
```

## Analytics Branch — Detailed Review

### Architecture: Well-structured

- Clean protocol-based abstraction (`AnalyticsProvider` with Firebase + Mock implementations)
- Proper consent gating — every `logEvent` checks `consent.isAnalyticsAllowed`
- Consent events correctly bypass the gate (call `provider.logEvent` directly)
- GA4 recommended events used where applicable
- `@MainActor` on both services — thread-safe for SwiftUI
- Taxonomy CSV perfectly matches code enums (20 events, 24 screens, 6 user properties, 5 conversions)

### Issues to Fix Before Merge

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **No test files committed** | HIGH | `MockAnalyticsAdapter` is built for testing but zero tests exist. The "23 tests" claimed in docs likely ran locally but weren't committed. Add tests. |
| **`GoogleService-Info.plist` not gitignored** | MEDIUM | Firebase client keys committed (API key `AIzaSyBl2R...`). Low risk (bundle-ID restricted) but not best practice. Document or gitignore. |
| **No SPM dependency in diff** | MEDIUM | Code imports `FirebaseCore`/`FirebaseAnalytics` but no Package.swift changes in diff. Verify Firebase SDK exists in Xcode project. |
| **`MockAnalyticsAdapter` in production target** | LOW | Should be `#if DEBUG` wrapped or in test target |
| **`exercise_name` param sends free text** | LOW | User-generated exercise names could be borderline PII. Consider using IDs. |
| **`setUserID` passes raw ID** | LOW | Fine if Supabase UUID, but add comment asserting it must be opaque |

## Skills Ecosystem Branch — Detailed Review

### Critical Finding: 20 Commits Behind Main

This branch forked from an OLD main (`ceb0efa`) and independently reimplemented much of the Design System v2 work that was later merged to main via PRs #15-#19. This creates **massive divergence** (196 files changed, +20,299 lines).

### What's Genuinely New & Valuable

| Addition | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 10 SKILL.md files (skills ecosystem) | New, well-structured |
| 8 shared JSON data files | New, internally consistent |
| `docs/project/skills-ecosystem.md` (770 lines) | New documentation |
| Backend CI Supabase auth stubs | Genuine CI fix |
| PR comment-on-failure CI feature | Genuine CI improvement |

### What Should Be Dropped (duplicate of main)

- All Design System v2 code changes (already on main via PR #17)
- All simulator/token cleanup (already on main via PR #18)
- All roadmap docs (already on main via PR #19)
- Dashboard work (already on main)

### File Reference Problem

Skills reference files that only exist on `feature/google-analytics`:
- `AnalyticsProvider.swift`, `AnalyticsService.swift`, `ConsentManager.swift`
- `analytics-taxonomy.csv`, `AnalyticsTests.swift`

**Skills assume google-analytics has been merged.** Merge google-analytics first.

### GoogleService-Info.plist Duplication

Two copies exist on this branch:
- `FitTracker/GoogleService-Info.plist` (correct)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (root — unnecessary duplicate, remove)

## Design System Alignment: Code vs Figma

### Token Comparison

| Category | Code | design-system.json | Figma | Gap |
|----------|-----:|-------------------:|------:|-----|
| Colors | ~45 | 45 | 46 | +1 in Figma (likely Focus.ring) |
| Spacing | 9 | 9 | 8 | **Figma missing `micro` (2pt)** |
| Radius | 9 | 9 | 6 | **Figma missing `micro`, `button`, `authSheet`** |
| Typography | 22 | 20 | 22 | JSON outdated (missing `metricDisplay`, `metricDisplayMono`) |
| Motion | 8 (code) | 8 | 4 | **Figma has only 4 of 8 motion tokens** |
| Shadow | 2 | 2 | 2 | Aligned |

### Figma Tokens to Add

- `Spacing/micro` (2pt)
- `Radius/micro` (4pt), `Radius/button` (20pt), `Radius/authSheet` (36pt)
- `Typography/metricDisplay`, `Typography/metricDisplayMono`
- 4 remaining motion tokens

## Raw Literals Bypassing the Design System

### Colors — Must Fix (repeated patterns)

| Pattern | Occurrences | Fix |
|---------|:-----------:|-----|
| `Color(red: 0.60, green: 0.35, blue: 0.15)` (brown/fat) | 4x across Nutrition views | Use existing `AppColor.Chart.nutritionFat` |
| `Color.white.opacity(0.72)` in auth buttons | ~10x in AuthHubView | Create `AppColor.Surface.materialLight` |
| `Color(red: 0.26, green: 0.52, blue: 0.96)` (Google blue) | 1x in AuthHubView | Create `AppColor.Brand.google` |
| `Color.green` for selection state | 2x in SettingsView | Use `AppColor.Status.success` |
| `Color.orange` for warnings | 2x in NutritionView | Use `AppColor.Status.warning` |
| `.foregroundStyle(.white)` | 3x in auth views | Use `AppColor.Text.inversePrimary` |

### Fonts — Must Fix

| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `SettingsView.swift` | `.system(size: 10, 14, 18)` — use AppText roles |
| `AccountPanelView.swift` | `.system(size: 9)` — use AppText.caption or smaller |
| `AuthHubView.swift` | 4 raw font sizes (16-24) — use AppText roles |
| `LiveInfoStrip.swift` | `.system(size: 26)` — use AppText.metric |

### Acceptable Exceptions (documented)

- `MainScreenView.swift` — responsive sizes with `// responsive -- no AppText equivalent` comments
- `TrainingPlanView.swift` — oversized icons with `// intentional oversized icon` comments

---

## Dual Directory Issue

The repo has **both** `FitTracker/` and `FitTracker2/FitTracker/` directories. `FitTracker/` appears to be the main source on migrated branches, while `FitTracker2/FitTracker/` is an older copy with more raw literals. **Must clarify which is canonical and remove the stale one before any merge.**

---

## Action Plan — Clean Slate Merge Sequence

### Phase 1: Cleanup (no code changes)

1. Delete 9 stale branches
2. Resolve `FitTracker/` vs `FitTracker2/FitTracker/` — pick canonical, remove other
3. Remove root-level `GoogleService-Info.plist` duplicate

### Phase 2: Merge `feature/google-analytics` → main

Pre-merge fixes:
- Verify Firebase SPM dependency exists in Xcode project
- Wrap `MockAnalyticsAdapter` in `#if DEBUG`
- Add comment on `setUserID` requiring opaque ID
- Decide on GoogleService-Info.plist gitignore policy

### Phase 3: Rebase & merge skills ecosystem

1. Rebase `claude/investigate-ci-failure-xP9kS` onto new main
2. Drop all commits that duplicate work already on main (DS v2, roadmap, dashboard)
3. Keep: 10 SKILL.md files, 8 shared JSONs, skills-ecosystem.md, CI fixes
4. Verify all file references in skills match post-analytics repo state
5. Merge

### Phase 4: Merge remaining features

- `feature/gdpr-compliance` → main (24 commits, full GDPR feature)
- `feature/marketing-website` → main (30 commits, Astro site + Android DS)

### Phase 5: Consolidate design system branches

- Compare `feat/design-system-v2` vs `claude/implement-mcp-server-AVtFa`
- Determine canonical tip, cherry-pick unique work, delete stale branch

### Phase 6: Fix raw literals

- Migrate the ~20 raw color/font literal patterns identified above
- Sync Figma variables to match code tokens (5 missing entries)
