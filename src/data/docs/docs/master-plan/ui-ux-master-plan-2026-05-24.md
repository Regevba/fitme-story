# FitMe UI/UX Master Plan — 2026-05-24

> **Item-tracking convention (FIT-200, est. 2026-06-29):** items here are tracked under the
> [cross-layer naming convention](../process/cross-layer-item-naming-convention.md) — **slug** (canonical) + **`FIT-NNN`**
> (`state.json.linear_id`) + **scheme-prefixed code**: this plan uses `PROD-` (product UI/UX).
> Status vocabulary (all layers): **Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Blocked → Done → Won't-Do**.
> Live per-item status: [`.claude/shared/item-registry.json`](../../.claude/shared/item-registry.json)
> (`make crosswalk`) + the Linear "Fitme project" board. Repo (`state.json.current_phase`) is
> the source of truth; this doc is a planning view. Bare thematic codes (`F4`/`T14`/`R14`) are
> retired in favor of prefixed codes to prevent the cross-scheme collisions reconciled 2026-06-29.

> **Status:** CURRENT · Opened 2026-05-24 as the 5th sub-doc of [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md). Platform-comprehensive revision 2026-05-24 expanded scope from "iOS + website" to "iOS + website + Android" (token + adaptation layer; Android app code not yet implemented) and reconciled 3 drift items + added missing `user-profile-settings` row.
> **Scope:** All UI/UX work across all platforms — iOS (FitTracker2), website (fitme-story), and Android (tokens + adaptation docs, no native app surface yet). Features, enhancements, and chores. Includes both shipped state and in-flight queue. Cross-references parent features (e.g., v2 alignment series under `design-system-v2`; UCC sub-features under `unified-control-center`; Android token pipeline under `android-design-system`).
> **Purpose:** Codify the surface-level UI/UX work that was previously distributed across `.claude/features/*/state.json`, `docs/product/backlog.md` rows, and memory entries. Single source of truth for "what UI/UX is shipped, in-flight, queued, or implicit." Mirrors backlog rows; lets operators answer "what should I work on next on the UI surface" without reading 60+ state.json files.
> **Why a sub-plan, not a section in the infra plan:** Same pattern as [`test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md), [`analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md), [`data-integrity-and-rollback-2026-05-14.md`](data-integrity-and-rollback-2026-05-14.md), and [`dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md`](dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md) — UI/UX has its own cadence (per-screen v2 alignment + ongoing polish + per-launch design-system evolution) that doesn't map onto the v7.x framework-version axis.
> **Authority:** Items here are work-type Feature / Enhancement / Chore. They do NOT promote into v7.9.1 / v8.x F-series. They ship in their own cadence using the standard PM workflow per work-type. Sub-features (e.g., `home-today-screen`) sit under parent features (e.g., `design-system-v2` / `ux-foundations.md`) and inherit gates from the parent's lineage.

## 0. TL;DR

**30 shipped, 3 in-flight, ~26 open backlog items across all three platforms (iOS + website + Android).**

### Headline counts (2026-05-31 freshness reconcile; platform-comprehensive revision)

| Category | iOS | Website | Android | Cross-cutting | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shipped features** | 16 | 10 | 1 | 2 | 29 |
| **Shipped enhancements** | 5 | 3 | — | — | 8 |
| **Shipped chores** | 3 | — | — | 2 | 5 |
| **In-flight (need attention)** | 2 | 1 | — | — | 3 |
| **Open backlog items** | ~17 | ~6 | ~3 | 1 | ~27 |

### Top 5 next actions

1. **Verify + backfill `ai-recommendation-ui` case_study link** — RESOLVED 2026-05-31: state.json has `case_study` pointing at parent `ai-engine-architecture-v5.1-case-study.md`. May need `case_study_type: parent` field to silence `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK` advisory cleanly
2. **C9 + C10 fitme-story-only polish bundle** — CLOSED 2026-05-24 PR-2B (see §3.4 row strikethroughs)
3. **Resume app-store-assets** (5/10 done per `paused_app_store_assets.md`) — needed for App Store launch surface; operator-paced
4. **Open the 3 memory-only design rules as backlog rows** — AI avatar / orbital pm-flow rollback / failure-recognition-layer — confirmed UX-R3+UX-R4 closed 2026-05-24 PR #472; UX-R5 remains Aspirational
5. **Apply fitme-story web design system to `/control-room/*`** — 14 internal components deferred per Internal-deferral policy; estimated 1-week if drift-only

> **Reconciled drift items (2026-05-31 freshness pass):** moved 4 features from §3.3 "In-flight" to "Reconciled to Done" — ucc-sign-in-figma-mapping + ucc-passkey-auth-security-hardening + ucc-passkey-auth-audit-log-redis-fix + fitme-story-public-enhancements (all confirmed `current_phase: complete` on disk via state.json after Phase E Day 6/7 closure batch). §3.3 now shows only `analytics-observability` (testing, deferred to post-Phase-E) + `3d-interactive-framework-flow-diagram` (paused PRD).
>
> **Reconciled drift items (2026-05-24 platform-comprehensive revision):** (a) `fitme-story-public-enhancements` confirmed `phase=complete` + 24/24 tasks done in state.json (UX-R1 already satisfied — no work needed); (b) `user-profile-settings` added as missing iOS shipped feature (was absent from §2.1); (c) `android-design-system` added as new §4 Android section (was excluded from prior scope).

## 1. Scope + Relationship to Infra Master Plan

### 1.1 What this plan covers

| Surface | Tracking mechanism owned by this plan |
|---|---|
| **iOS app UI screens** (Views, Components, ViewModels) | Yes — feature + enhancement entries §2 |
| **iOS design system** (tokens, components, ux-foundations.md adherence) | Yes — shipped tracking + open Residual list §2 |
| **iOS UI polish chores** (ui-audit P1 drift, VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, dark-mode E2E) | Yes — backlog rows §2.5 |
| **Website public pages** (case-studies, glossary, framework, marketing) | Yes — fitme-story-public-enhancements + sub-features §3 |
| **Website operator dashboard** (`/control-room/*`) | Yes — UCC + UU items §3 |

| **Marketing assets** (App Store screenshots, ASO copy, marketing graphics) | Yes — app-store-assets feature §2.4 |

### 1.2 What this plan does NOT cover

| Concern | Owned by |
|---|---|
| Analytics events firing in UI flows | [`analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](analytics-master-plan-2026-05-13.md) |
| Per-screen test coverage | [`test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md`](test-coverage-master-plan-2026-05-13.md) §2.2 (iOS) + §2.3 (web) |
| Pre-commit / CI gate definitions | [`infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) §2.2 + this doc references the per-PR `ui-audit` gate |
| Dev-env lint/format tooling for UI code | [`dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md`](dev-env-master-plan-2026-05-24.md) R7 (SwiftLint) + R12 (markdownlint for prose) |
| Backend / API / sync logic | Out of scope — separate concerns |
| Performance / Core Web Vitals tracking | [`fitme-story-discoverability-plan-2026-05-20.md`](fitme-story-discoverability-plan-2026-05-20.md) + future R20 Lighthouse-CI |

### 1.3 Relationship to other sub-plans

| Sub-plan | Where it intersects this plan |
|---|---|
| `test-coverage-master-plan` | T2 (iOS Sentry reachability) → SignInService.swift screen; T6 (web PR JS gate) **closed via fitme-story #137** — web component tests baseline |
| `analytics-master-plan` | F19 / F20 (GA4 conversion event types + Firebase event-name cleanup) affect Settings + Onboarding analytics taxonomy |
| `dev-env-master-plan` | R6 (.editorconfig + .vscode) standardizes UI-author IDE; R7 (SwiftLint) will lint SwiftUI files; R9 (coverage) feeds UI-test discipline |
| `fitme-story-discoverability-plan` | DISCO P2 work on dashboard redirects + path preservation overlaps with this plan's website ownership |
| `ucc-hardening-infra-overlay-2026-05-19` | UCC sign-in / devices / audit-log UI surface |

### 1.4 Authority + cadence

- **Per-screen v2 alignment** is governed by [`docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md`](../design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md) (one-time per pre-PM-workflow screen)
- **New UI features** flow through `/pm-workflow` Phase 3 UX/Integration with [`/ux preflight`](../skills/ux.md) + [`/design preflight`](../skills/design.md) gates
- **Polish + drift** flows through the `ui-audit` P1 fix-as-you-touch rule per [CLAUDE.md "CI Pipeline"](../../CLAUDE.md)
- **Design system evolution** governed by [CLAUDE.md "Design System (Living Framework)"](../../CLAUDE.md) — token additions in same commit as backing colorset; per-feature memory in [`docs/design-system/feature-memory.md`](../design-system/feature-memory.md)

### 2.5 Open iOS UI/UX backlog ([`docs/product/backlog.md`](../product/backlog.md))

**§ Medium Priority — UX Improvements** (lines 280–292):

- [ ] Chart goal target lines — weight/BF goals not overlaid on stats charts
- [ ] Chart tap-to-tooltip interaction — mentioned in v2 spec, unclear status
- [ ] Trend alerts — no notification when HRV drops below threshold for 3+ days
- [ ] Exercise search/filter — 87 exercises in fixed order, no search
- [ ] Training program customization — fixed 6-day PPL split (partially addressed by Import Training Plan)
- [ ] Notification settings screen — backend `NotificationPreferencesStore` exists but no user-facing UI
- [ ] Data export from Settings — JSON export UI exists; CSV format not yet implemented
- [ ] User feedback loop for AI — can't rate recommendation quality
- [ ] Dark Mode end-to-end testing — asset catalog has values but not verified
- [ ] Dynamic Type full compliance — `@ScaledMetric` not on all text tokens
- [x] ~~Code Connect (Figma ↔ code mapping)~~ — SHIPPED via `ios-code-connect`

**§ Low Priority — Nice-to-Have** (lines 294–307):

- [ ] Rep max calculator (1RM estimation UI)
- [ ] Supersets / circuits logging
- [ ] Custom exercise creation
- [ ] Meal timing analysis
- [ ] Photo-based food logging (Vision/ML)
- [ ] AI meal suggestions based on remaining macros
- [ ] Chart export/share (screenshot or CSV)
- [ ] Chart comparison mode (overlay two metrics)
- [ ] Apple Watch complication
- [ ] iOS home screen / lock screen widgets
- [ ] iPad / macOS optimized layouts
- [ ] No passcode fallback for biometric lock
- [ ] Phone OTP registration (deferred per `docs/design-system/deferred-phone-otp-task.md`)

**§ Design System Residual** (lines 309–313):

- [x] ~~9 raw literals remaining across views (responsive micro-adjustments)~~ — **CLOSED 2026-05-26** per [`docs/design-system/ui-audit-p1-residual-2026-05-26.md`](../design-system/ui-audit-p1-residual-2026-05-26.md). Live `make ui-audit` reports P0=0 + P1=0; the "9 remaining" was a stale snapshot from the May 11 burndown window — subsequent `ios-ui-audit-p1-drift-cleanup` closed them. Separate baseline-doc regeneration PR queued
- [x] ~~Android token output for Style Dictionary (now tracked as AND-1 in §4.4)~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-06-17.** `sd.config.android.mjs` (custom-transforms path) generates committed `android/FitMeDesignTokens.kt` + `android/res/values/{colors,dimens}.xml`; `npm run tokens:android:check` drift gate is green (artifacts in sync with `tokens.json`, verified 2026-07-01)
- [x] ~~VoiceOver labels comprehensive audit~~ — **DONE 2026-05-26** per [`docs/design-system/voiceover-audit-2026-05-26.md`](../design-system/voiceover-audit-2026-05-26.md). 21 v2 files scanned; 7 files flagged P1 (zero or low label/tap ratio); 19 interactive elements need labels (~10 hr total fix-as-you-touch). Audit doc identifies file:line per finding
- [ ] Figma old frame cleanup

**Implicit:** ~~`make ui-audit` P1 drift +5 (baseline 103 → current 108)~~ — **STALE; CORRECTED 2026-05-26.** Live `make ui-audit` reports P1 = 0 (0 files-with-findings out of 101 scanned). `ios-ui-audit-p1-drift-cleanup` (active feature, `phase=complete`) closed the residual after the May 11 burndown. Baseline doc still reads P1=44 — pending regeneration PR. See [`ui-audit-p1-residual-2026-05-26.md`](../design-system/ui-audit-p1-residual-2026-05-26.md). Fix-as-you-touch policy remains active per [CLAUDE.md "CI Pipeline"](../../CLAUDE.md)

> **2026-05-29 freshness verification — Post-v7.9 Phase E overlay buckets were STALE.** The Phase E overlay (2026-05-21) rolled up the 2026-05-08 fitme-story enhancement-queue audit and never re-verified against main. A full audit against current `fitme-story` main on 2026-05-29 found **14/15 enhancement-queue items already SHIPPED** (largely via `fitme-story-public-enhancements`). Bucket disposition with file:line evidence:
>
> - **UX-1→9 (visual/typography): SHIPPED** — `Pre` syntax highlighting (`mdx-components.tsx:9,36` + `rehype-pretty-code` in `package.json:47`), callout family (`src/components/mdx/callouts/*`, 5 components), responsive tables (`globals.css:222-230`), nav chrome (`SiteHeader.tsx`).
> - **IA-1→8 (info architecture): SHIPPED** — `ArticleNav` (`src/components/case-study/ArticleNav.tsx`, wired Standard+Flagship templates), `TimelineNav` (rendered in all 3 templates), heading anchors (`rehype-slug`+`rehype-autolink-headings` at `case-studies/[slug]/page.tsx:71-81`), site-wide search (`src/app/search/page.tsx` + ⌘K `SearchInput.tsx`), G3 dual-outlet doc, G5 frontmatter uniform.
> - **A11Y-1→7 (accessibility): SHIPPED** — skip-link (`layout.tsx:48-52`), neutral-500 contrast bumped to #5C5754 4.83:1 (`globals.css:36`), aria-current + focus-ring, `MobileNav` focus-trapped dialog.
> - **COPY-1→5 (microcopy): SHIPPED** — chrome-backfill frontmatter (`honest_disclosures`/`visual_aid` on recent slots), back-links, callout narrative copy.
> - **DS-2→6 (control-room DS): SUBSTANTIALLY SATISFIED** — bulk hex→token migration already shipped (`bg-[#1A1F2E]` → `bg-[var(--color-neutral-800)]` etc.); components use `text-[var(--color-neutral-*)]`. Residual `text-amber-500` / `text-[10px]` / `bg-white/[0.08]` is **policy-permitted standard Tailwind** (§3 Internal; no semantic alert/text-scale tokens exist to migrate to). See FIT-135.
> - **PERF-1→6 (performance): PARTIAL** — `next/font` configured (`src/app/fonts.ts`), Vercel SpeedInsights wired (`layout.tsx:59`), `next/image` already used (`Figure.tsx` for MDX images; zero plain `<img>` in components). **Only genuine gap: Lighthouse-CI / web-vitals reporting** (no config exists) — infra-glob, tracked separately.

**§ High Priority — Architecture & Framework rows** (UI/UX-relevant):

- [x] ~~**Apply fitme-story web design system to `/control-room/*`**~~ — **SUBSTANTIALLY SATISFIED (verified 2026-05-29).** Bulk hex→token migration shipped; control-room components on `var(--color-neutral-*)`. Residual standard-Tailwind is §3-policy-permitted (no semantic tokens to migrate to). FIT-135 narrowed to optional marginal polish, stays Low. Figma-stub path remains blocked by FIT-132.
- [ ] **Complete Figma design + architecture for both surfaces (iOS + website)** (line 204) — 2-3 week Feature; (A) fitme-story Figma new build + (B) iOS coverage audit + (C) architecture doc per surface
- [x] ~~**Site-wide search on fitme-story public site**~~ — **SHIPPED (verified 2026-05-29).** `/search` route with faceted filters (category/version/tier/glossary) + ⌘K header `SearchInput` + custom scored index (`src/lib/search.ts`); not Pagefind but functionally complete.
- [ ] **PERF — Lighthouse-CI / web-vitals baseline** (NEW 2026-05-29) — only genuine open item from the PERF bucket. `.lighthouserc.json` + `.github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml` + optional `web-vitals` reporting. Infra-glob → ship via isolated worktree (not Phase-E-safe on main).
- [ ] **fitme-story website DS — ongoing build-out** (line 191) — showcase route + drift detection + dark-mode parity audit + token additions + contribution guidelines

### 3.5 Drift / reconciliation items

| Drift | Detection method | Status / Fix scope |

## 4. Android — Current State (cross-platform token authoring; no native app code yet)

### 4.1 Scope clarification

Android is treated as a **second platform layer built on the same FitTracker semantics**, not a second independent system. The order codified in [`docs/design-system/android-adaptation.md`](../design-system/android-adaptation.md): (1) define FitMe semantic roles → (2) validate on Apple platforms → (3) map into Material 3 roles and Android-native interaction patterns. This plan owns the token-pipeline + adaptation-docs surface; an Android app implementation (Jetpack Compose views + theming + tests) is **explicitly out-of-scope** until a separate feature kicks off.

### 4.2 Shipped Android features (1)

| Feature | Phase | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `android-design-system` | complete | feature (research-only) | SHIPPED 2026-04-04 (framework pre-v5.0). 92 iOS tokens → MD3 mapping; Style Dictionary dual-output config. Case study `docs/case-studies/android-design-system-case-study.md`; showcase MDX `24a-android-design-system.mdx`. Parent: `six-features-roundup-case-study.md`. `has_ui: false` — no Android view code |

### 4.3 Android design-system artifacts (live, maintained)

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Style Dictionary Android config | [`design-tokens/config-android.json`](../../design-tokens/config-android.json) | Dual-output: `android-compose` → `FitMeDesignTokens.kt` (Compose object) + `android-xml` → `res/values/` XML resources |
| Token mapping reference | [`docs/design-system/android-token-mapping.md`](../design-system/android-token-mapping.md) | 92 iOS → MD3 mapping table (46 colors / 22 typography / 9 spacing / 9 radius / 4 shadow / 14 motion = 104 total; 72 MD3-mapped + 32 custom) |
| Adaptation strategy | [`docs/design-system/android-adaptation.md`](../design-system/android-adaptation.md) | Strategy doc: token mapping table + component translation (direct semantic equivalents + Android-specific patterns) |

### 4.4 Open Android backlog (~3)

| ID | Item | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**AND-1**~~ | ~~Generate Android token output and commit `android/FitMeDesignTokens.kt` + `android/res/values/*.xml` outputs as compiled artifacts~~ | **SHIPPED 2026-06-17** | **Resolved via path (1)** — custom-transforms wrapper [`sd.config.android.mjs`](../../sd.config.android.mjs) registers the Compose `dp`/`sp` transforms; `make tokens-android` / `npm run tokens:android` emits committed `FitMeDesignTokens.kt` (Compose object) + `res/values/{colors,dimens}.xml`. Drift gate `npm run tokens:android:check` green (in sync with `tokens.json`, re-verified 2026-07-01). Full disposition in [`docs/design-system/android-token-mapping.md`](../design-system/android-token-mapping.md) §0 |
| ~~**AND-2**~~ | ~~Validate `android-token-mapping.md` against current `tokens.json`~~ | **DONE 2026-05-25** | Audit found substantial drift: 92 doc count → 108 actual tokens (+4 net but type taxonomy restructured: +Opacity/Layout/Size categories, Motion -8, Typography -6, Colors +3). Drift captured in [`android-token-mapping.md`](../design-system/android-token-mapping.md) §0 Audit Note. Per-row mapping refresh (sections 1-6) deferred to next quarterly pass or to `android-app-implementation` kickoff |
| ~~**AND-3**~~ | ~~Decide trigger condition for `android-app-implementation` feature kickoff~~ | **DONE 2026-05-26** | Decision: **deferred indefinitely**. iOS + web are the production surfaces; Android stays at the token + adaptation-doc layer. Re-evaluation triggers: (a) App Store launch + first 1000 iOS WAU sustained 30 days; (b) External partner request; (c) Annual review (next 2027-05-26; default = stay deferred). Codified in [`android-design-system/state.json::android_app_implementation_kickoff_trigger`](../../.claude/features/android-design-system/state.json) + this row |

### 4.5 Android — not in scope (intentionally deferred)

- **Android app codebase** — no Kotlin/Compose source tree exists; no `android/` Gradle project; no `MainActivity.kt`. The `config-android.json` builds INTO an empty `android/` directory if invoked
- **Android Code Connect (`.figma.kt` mappings)** — depends on Android app codebase existing first
- **Android UI tests** — depends on app codebase
- **Play Store assets** — listed in `app-store-assets` ASO scope but currently iOS-only (Apple App Store)
- **Android dark mode / motion / accessibility audit** — depends on app codebase

> **Re-evaluation trigger:** when an `android-app-implementation` feature kicks off (see AND-3), this section expands into full §2-parity treatment (shipped/in-flight/backlog/residual subsections). Until then, Android scope here stays scoped to "token + adaptation layer is ready and maintained; native app code is not".

## 5. Cross-cutting — All platforms

| Track | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Figma ↔ code Code Connect bridge** | CLAUDE.md "v4.X+CC" + memory `project_session_2026_05_09_codeconnect_caseaudit.md` | Foundation SHIPPED 2026-05-10; T5 (end-to-end test) blocked on Figma `code_connect:write` scope — see backlog row "Re-activate Code Connect publish when Figma seat/plan unblocks" (line 190) |
| **Design system evolution doc** | [`docs/design-system/feature-memory.md`](../design-system/feature-memory.md) + [`docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md`](../design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md) | Living docs, no specific open task |
| **UX foundations 13 principles** | [`docs/design-system/ux-foundations.md`](../design-system/ux-foundations.md) | Source-of-truth for v2 alignment; enforced via `/ux preflight` |
| **UI-audit verification** | `make ui-audit` → [`docs/design-system/ui-audit-baseline.md`](../design-system/ui-audit-baseline.md) | P0 = 0 (hard gate); P1 = 0 as of 2026-05-26 (was advisory at +5; reconciled per `ui-audit-p1-residual-2026-05-26.md`); baseline doc regen PR queued |
| **Figma↔code matrix** | [`docs/design-system/figma-code-sync-status.md`](../design-system/figma-code-sync-status.md) | Tracks per-screen sync status iOS + web (Android not yet present) |
| **Style Dictionary token pipeline** | [`design-tokens/tokens.json`](../../design-tokens/tokens.json) → iOS (`DesignTokens.swift`) + Android (`sd.config.android.mjs`) | Authoritative single-source for all 92+ semantic tokens across all 3 platforms; iOS + Android outputs both committed (AND-1 shipped 2026-06-17) |
| **Cross-platform design rules** | [`docs/design-system/design-rules.md`](../design-system/design-rules.md) | Platform-agnostic rules; currently iOS-focused, candidate doc for AI-avatar / orbital / failure-recognition rules per UX-R3/R4/R5 |
| **Cross-platform governance** | [`docs/design-system/design-system-governance.md`](../design-system/design-system-governance.md) | Token-add, component-add, deprecation policy across all platforms |

## 6. Implementation calendar

Calendar-safe ordering. No new gates ship in Phase E (2026-05-21 → 2026-06-04); UI/UX work is feature/enhancement/chore — not gate-additive — so safe to ship at any time as long as branch-isolation rules respected.

| Window | Items | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **today (2026-05-24)** | (1) Open the 3 memory-only design rules as backlog rows (UX-R3 / R4 / R5) · (2) Verify + backfill `ai-recommendation-ui` case-study link (UX-R2) · (3) AND-1 Android token output generation if Android touched | Pure reconciliation / quick fix, no UI code |
| **2026-05-24 → 2026-05-27** | C9 (coral-pulse) + C10 (4 dark-mode contrast checks) bundled in one PR | fitme-story only; no infra-glob; no Phase E conflict |
| **2026-05-28 → 2026-06-04** | Resume `app-store-assets` (5/10 done → ship S3-G3 → S5 → S4 → S7 → S6 → S8 → S9) | iOS-only; pre-launch hygiene |
| **2026-06-05+** (post Phase E exit) | "Apply fitme-story DS to `/control-room/*`" (line 203) OR "Complete Figma design for both surfaces" (line 204) — pick one as a Feature for v7.9.1 build window | Full PM-workflow Feature; multi-week |
| **2026-06-15 → 2026-07-15** | Site-wide search on fitme-story (Pagefind static index) | Feature; full 10-phase |
| **2026-08+** | Tackle iOS Medium Priority UX queue (chart improvements, notification settings UI, dark-mode E2E, Dynamic Type compliance) as a rolling enhancement series · AND-2 Android token mapping drift validation | Per backlog priority |
| **Post-App-Store-launch (Q4 2026+)** | Tier 4 Low Priority items — widgets, Watch complication, iPad/macOS layouts · AND-3 decision on `android-app-implementation` kickoff trigger | Coupled to launch milestone |

---

## 7. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `make ui-audit` P1 drift continues to grow past +5 if fix-as-you-touch policy slips | Medium | Low (advisory, not gate) | Quarterly P1 burndown sweep; promote to hard gate at +20 drift |
| `app-store-assets` resumes too late and gates App Store submission | Medium | High (launch blocker) | Operator-paced; explicit scheduled-after signal at 2026-05-28 → 2026-06-04 window |
| Dark Mode E2E never reaches "verified" status — ships untested | High | Medium (post-launch user complaints) | Quarterly audit; or fold into automated snapshot-test discipline once test-coverage T3 ships |
| Memory-only design rules (AI avatar, orbital, failure recognition) get lost when memory rotates | High | Low-Medium (rule is mostly self-evident from existing code) | Promote to backlog or to `docs/design-system/design-rules.md` (new doc, future) |
| `ai-recommendation-ui` ships with no case-study link, fails `STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK` on next mutation | High | Low (gate is enforced; will fail loudly) | Verify link today; backfill if absent |
| `ucc-passkey-auth-security-hardening` B12 kill-criteria evaluation on 2026-05-27 lands a finding | Low | Medium (would require revert) | Hardening work has been observed cleanly for 3+ days; risk is low |
| Polish bundle (C9 + C10) cross-contaminates the post-v7.9 Phase E soak | Low | Low | Items are fitme-story-only, no FT2 gate impact, no infra-glob |
| Android `tokens.json` → MD3 mapping drift as new iOS tokens land without back-propagation to `android-token-mapping.md` | Medium | Low (Android app not yet built; drift is doc-only until kickoff) | AND-2 quarterly validation; promote to a `make tokens-check-android-mapping` gate if/when Android app kicks off |
| AND-3 decision delayed indefinitely; Android token pipeline atrophies through neglect | Low-Medium | Low (current state is "deferred, ready") | Annual review during yearly architecture audit; explicit "stay deferred" decision recorded |

---

## 8. Open questions

1. **Should `fitme-story-public-enhancements` close as a single rollup or be split into per-task case studies?** ~~Pending~~ **DECIDED 2026-05-24** — already shipped as a rollup; 24/24 done; `current_phase=complete`. Single rollup case study is the format. No further action.
2. **`app-store-assets` resume preconditions** — are S3-G3 / S5 / S4 / S7 / S6 / S8 / S9 still the correct ordering given any product changes since 2026-05-08 deferral? Re-validate at resume.
3. **`/control-room/*` design-system application — drift-only vs full Figma stubs?** Drift-only is ~1 week; Figma stubs add ~2 weeks. Operator decides at scope-confirmation. Default: drift-only (Internal-deferral policy was explicit about operator-only surfaces being code-first).
4. **Should the 3 memory-only design rules become a new `docs/design-system/design-rules.md` doc OR backlog rows?** Doc has more permanence + can be linked from CLAUDE.md; backlog rows decay faster but easier to triage. Default: backlog rows now, doc later if rule count grows past ~10. Note: `design-rules.md` exists and could be the natural home.
5. **Site-wide search — Pagefind vs Fuse.js OR custom Vercel KV store?** Pagefind is the recommended default (static build-time index, ~80 docs ≈ tiny bundle, zero runtime cost). Confirm at /pm-workflow start.
6. **iOS Medium Priority UX queue — bundle as a single "v7.x polish enhancement" feature OR ship one-at-a-time?** Bundling preserves design coherence across changes (e.g., chart improvements should ship together); one-at-a-time preserves PR review focus. Recommend bundle for chart items, individual ship for accessibility + notification settings.
7. **Dark Mode E2E verification methodology** — manual visual review (operator-driven) OR snapshot tests (R9 coverage + dedicated XCSnapshot harness)? Defer until R9 coverage instrumentation lands (~2026-05-25).
8. **AND-3: when (if ever) does `android-app-implementation` kick off?** Three candidate triggers: (a) App Store launch + first 1000 iOS WAU (most common cross-platform path); (b) operator decides iOS + web are the production surfaces and Android stays "tokens-only" indefinitely; (c) external request (school project requirement, partner ask, etc.). Default: stay deferred; revisit annually.
9. **Should `make tokens-check` extend to cover Android-mapping drift?** Today `tokens-check` validates iOS-only. AND-2 covers the manual diff. Promote to automated check if/when Android app kicks off OR if the drift starts compounding.
