# PRD: Marketing Website

> **ID:** Task 16 | **Status:** In Progress | **Priority:** HIGH (RICE 4.3)
> **Last Updated:** 2026-04-12 | **Branch:** feature/marketing-website (merged to main)

---

## Purpose

Build FitMe's public marketing website — the app's front door for organic search, paid acquisition, social sharing, and App Store downloads.

## Business Objective

Establish web presence for FitMe. Currently zero organic traffic, zero SEO footprint, zero web-to-App Store conversion funnel. This site is the foundation for all future marketing.

## Reality Check

- The marketing website code exists in the repo, but it is not the canonical live surface today.
- The canonical `fit-tracker2` Vercel project is currently rooted at `dashboard/`, which means `fit-tracker2.vercel.app` serves the operations control room rather than the public marketing site.
- The marketing site still contains launch blockers such as placeholder GA4 IDs, placeholder App Store URLs, and unverified aggregate-rating metadata.
- Treat this PRD as "implemented in code, not yet truthfully launched."

## Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `website/src/pages/index.astro` | Main page |
| `website/src/components/*.astro` | 9 components (Nav, Hero, Features, Screenshots, HowItWorks, Privacy, FAQ, CTA, Footer) |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Monthly unique visitors | 0 (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | 500 (T2 — Declared) | 90 days post-launch |
| App Store CTR | 0% (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | >5% (T2 — Declared) | 90 days |
| Bounce rate | N/A — pre-launch (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | <60% (T2 — Declared) | 90 days |
| Avg time on page | N/A — pre-launch (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | >45 seconds (T2 — Declared) | 90 days |
| Lighthouse score | N/A — pre-launch (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | >90 all categories (T2 — Declared) | At launch |
| Kill criteria | Monthly unique visitors <50 sustained for 90 days post-launch OR App Store CTR <0.5% sustained 90 days OR Lighthouse score drops below 70 in any category sustained 30 days → marketing site is considered failed and replaced with a static App Store redirect (T2 — Declared, 2026-04-26) | — | — |

## Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with real GA4 Measurement ID
- [ ] Update App Store URL when listing is live
- [ ] Connect custom domain (fitme.app)
- [ ] Verify OG preview renders on social platforms
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Remove or verify aggregate rating / review metadata in JSON-LD
- [ ] Decide whether marketing lives in the canonical `fit-tracker2` Vercel project or a separate production project/domain
