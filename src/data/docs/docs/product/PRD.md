## Part 1: Product Strategy

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**Problem:** Serious fitness enthusiasts use 3-5 separate apps to track their training, nutrition, recovery, and body composition. This fragmentation creates:

- **Data silos** — workout data in one app, nutrition in another, sleep in a third. No unified picture of readiness or progress.
- **Decision fatigue** — users check multiple dashboards to answer a simple question: "What should I do today?"
- **Privacy erosion** — each app collects health data independently, often uploading raw biometrics to separate cloud services with varying security practices.
- **Inconsistent UX** — switching between apps with different design languages, interaction patterns, and data entry flows wastes time and breaks flow.

**Who is affected:** Health-conscious individuals who train consistently (3-6 days/week), track macros, and want to understand how their body responds over time. These users are underserved by generic fitness apps that treat training, nutrition, and recovery as unrelated activities.

**Why now:** Apple's ecosystem (HealthKit, Foundation Models, Secure Enclave) enables a privacy-first approach where sensitive health data never leaves the device unencrypted. No competitor combines federated AI intelligence with zero-knowledge encryption in a single native app.

### 1.2 Product Vision & Elevator Pitch

**Vision:** FitMe is the iPhone-first fitness command center that unifies training, nutrition, recovery, and body composition into a single privacy-first experience — powered by federated AI that learns from population patterns while keeping your data encrypted on your device.

**Elevator pitch:** "FitMe replaces your training log, meal tracker, and recovery dashboard with one app that knows what you should do today — without ever seeing your private health data."

**North star metric:** Weekly Active Users who complete at least one training session AND log at least one meal (cross-feature engagement).

### 1.3 Target Personas

#### Primary: The Consistent Lifter
- **Demographics:** 25-40 years old, trains 4-6 days/week, has 1-5 years of structured training experience
- **Goals:** Build muscle, track progressive overload, optimize nutrition for body composition
- **Pain points:** Logging workouts is tedious, can't see how nutrition affects recovery, uses 3+ apps
- **Jobs to be done:** Know what to train today, log sets efficiently, hit macro targets, see if they're recovering
- **Devices:** iPhone (primary), Apple Watch (secondary)

#### Secondary: The Health-Conscious Professional
- **Demographics:** 30-50 years old, trains 3-4 days/week, values efficiency and simplicity
- **Goals:** Maintain fitness, manage weight, improve sleep and recovery
- **Pain points:** Too many screens, too much data entry, wants actionable guidance not raw numbers
- **Jobs to be done:** Quick daily check-in, simple meal logging, understand readiness
- **Devices:** iPhone only

#### Tertiary: The Data-Driven Optimizer
- **Demographics:** 25-45, deep interest in biomarkers, body composition, and performance trends
- **Goals:** Optimize every variable — sleep, HRV, nutrition timing, training periodization
- **Pain points:** Existing apps don't cross-reference enough data, wants DEXA integration, blood work trends
- **Jobs to be done:** Deep stats analysis, export data, overlay multiple metrics over time
- **Devices:** iPhone, Apple Watch, potentially Android (future)

### 1.4 Value Proposition

**Key differentiators:**

| FitMe | Competitors |
|-------|-------------|
| One app for training + nutrition + recovery + stats | Separate apps for each |

---

### 2.2 Nutrition Logging

**Purpose:** Enable users to track daily macro intake (protein, carbs, fat), log meals from multiple sources, monitor supplement adherence, and see adaptive calorie targets based on training day and body composition goals.

**Business objective:** Second-highest engagement driver after training. Users who log meals AND train have the highest retention. Nutrition data feeds the AI recommendation engine for cohort analysis.

**Functional requirements:**

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Macro target bar | Shipped | Stacked P/C/F progress with calorie totals, always pinned |
| Dynamic targets | Shipped | Calories/macros vary by phase, training day, weight gap, BF gap |

| Date navigation | Shipped | View/edit past days' nutrition |
| Adherence badges | Shipped | Protein %, calorie %, macro compliance summary |
| Allulose tracking | Shipped | Optional allulose intake flag |

**Nutrition planning logic:**
- Phase-based: Recovery (1800/1600 cal), Stage 1 (2000/1800), Stage 2 (variable)
- Training day calories > rest day calories
- Protein target: 2.0 × lean body mass (fallback 125-135g)
- Mode-aware: fat loss / maintain / gain adjusts macro ratios

**Key user flows:**
1. Open Nutrition tab → see today's macro progress (bar always visible)
2. Tap "Log Meal" → 4-tab sheet (Smart, Manual, Template, Search)
3. Enter or select meal → macros update in real-time
4. Toggle morning/evening supplement status → streak updates
5. Quick-log from recent meals → one-tap re-logging

**Current state & gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Food database search | Medium | Text search is wired through OpenFoodFacts; remaining work is result quality, fallback behavior, and broader validation coverage |
| Barcode scanning | Medium | Camera scanning is wired to OpenFoodFacts lookup; remaining work is validation depth and UX hardening |
| Meal timing analysis | Low | Meals have timestamps but no timing recommendations |
| Photo-based logging | Medium | No image recognition for food (could use Vision/ML) |
| Meal planning / suggestions | Low | No AI-driven meal suggestions based on remaining macros |

**Success metrics:**
- Meals logged per user per day (target: 2+)
- Supplement adherence rate (% of days both morning + evening completed)
- Protein target hit rate (% of days within ±10% of target)

### 2.3 Recovery & Biometrics

**Purpose:** Capture and display daily health metrics (weight, body fat, HRV, resting HR, sleep) from HealthKit and manual entry, computing a readiness score that guides training decisions.

**Business objective:** Recovery data enables the "intelligent" layer — without biometrics, the app is just a logging tool. Readiness scoring differentiates FitMe from competitors and drives daily check-in habits.

**Functional requirements:**

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| HealthKit auto-import | Shipped | HR, HRV, VO2Max, steps, active calories, sleep (total/deep/REM) |
| Manual biometric entry | Shipped | Weight, body fat, LBM, muscle mass, bone mass, visceral fat, water %, BMI, metabolic age, BMR |
| Manual fallback | Shipped | Manual HR, HRV, sleep hours when HealthKit unavailable |
| Effective values | Shipped | Auto-import preferred, falls back to manual entry seamlessly |
| Readiness scoring | Shipped | Based on resting HR (<75) + HRV (≥28) thresholds |
| Status dots | Shipped | Color-coded: green (good), amber (caution), red (alert) |
| HRV zone bands | Shipped | Green ≥35ms, amber 28-35ms, red <28ms |
| Xiaomi S400 support | Shipped | Body composition via manual entry from smart scale |
| Zone 2 HR detection | Shipped | Configurable bands (default 106-124 bpm) |

**Readiness logic:**
```
isReadyForTraining = (restingHR < 75) AND (hrv >= 28)
```
Thresholds configurable via UserPreferences.

**Current state & gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| No readiness score formula | Medium | Currently binary (ready/not ready); needs weighted 0-100 score |
| No trend alerts | Medium | No notification when HRV drops below threshold for 3+ days |
| No DEXA import | Low | Manual body comp only; no structured DEXA report parsing |
| No blood pressure tracking | Low | Field not in DailyBiometrics |
| No respiratory rate | Low | Available in HealthKit but not imported |

**Success metrics:**
- Daily biometric entry rate (% of active days with ≥1 metric logged)
- HealthKit connection rate (% of users with HealthKit authorized)
- Readiness check-in rate (% of users who view readiness daily)

**Key files:**
- `FitTracker/Services/HealthKit/HealthKitService.swift`

**ReadinessCard pages:**
1. Readiness score + HRV/RHR/Sleep
2. Weekly training mini bars (Mon-Sun)
3. Nutrition snapshot (calories, protein, supplement status)
4. 7-day trends (weight, BF, HRV, sleep, volume, steps — color-coded)
5. Achievements (supplement streak, PRs, program day)

**Current state & gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| No push notifications | Medium | No morning readiness notification or training reminder |
| No widgets | Low | No iOS home screen or lock screen widgets |

                              Background → LockScreen → Biometric → Authenticated
```

**Session model:**
- `UserSession`: provider, userID, displayName, email, phone, sessionToken, backendAccessToken (JWT), credentialID
- Stored in Keychain (encrypted)
- JWT for AI Engine API calls

**Current state & gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Google Sign In runtime verification | High | Repo wiring and compile verification are complete, but local credentials and end-to-end validation are still pending |
| Facebook Sign In not implemented | Low | Enum case only |
| Session refresh and recovery validation | Medium | Broader runtime auth QA is still required before auth can be called production-ready |
| No passcode fallback | Low | Only biometric — no PIN/pattern alternative |

| Data export UX from Settings | Medium | GDPR export exists, but there is still no dedicated Settings surface for initiating or tracking exports |
| Account deletion UX polish | Medium | GDPR deletion exists, but the destructive flow still needs broader UX and runtime validation |
| CloudKit unavailable on Simulator | Low | Known iOS limitation, Supabase covers sync |
| No offline conflict UI | Low | Conflicts resolved silently (last-write-wins) |
| No sync health indicator in UI | Low | Settings shows status but no persistent badge |

**Success metrics:**
- Sync success rate (% of push/pull operations without errors)
- Sync latency (p50/p95 time for incremental pull)
- Encryption overhead (ms added per read/write operation)
- Multi-device adoption (% of users syncing across 2+ devices)

### 2.9 AI / Cohort Intelligence

**Purpose:** Federated AI recommendation engine that combines population-level cohort signals (cloud) with private on-device personalization — without ever exposing individual PII to any server.

**Business objective:** AI recommendations are the premium differentiator. Users who receive actionable insights (e.g., "your cohort's data suggests reducing volume this week") have higher engagement and willingness to pay for premium tier.

**Functional requirements:**

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| AIOrchestrator | Shipped | Dual-path: cloud baseline + on-device personalization |
| 4 recommendation segments | Shipped | Training, Nutrition, Recovery, Stats |
| Privacy-preserving bands | Shipped | Age → "25-34", sleep → "7-8", BMI → "25-29.9" (no raw PII sent) |
| Cloud AI Engine | Shipped | FastAPI on Railway, JWT-authenticated, JWKS validation |
| On-device Foundation Model | Shipped | iOS 26+ Apple Intelligence with FallbackFoundationModel for older devices |
| Confidence scoring | Shipped | 0.0-1.0 scale; ≥0.4 threshold for acceptance |
| k-anonymity floor | Shipped | k=50 minimum cohort size before returning population signals |
| Rate limiting | Shipped | Per-user request throttling on cloud endpoint |
| Offline fallback | Shipped | Local rule-based recommendations when cloud unavailable |

**Data flow:**
```
LocalUserSnapshot (on-device)
  → Band extraction (age_band, bmi_band, etc.)
    → Cloud POST /v1/{segment}/insight (only bands + JWT)
      → AIRecommendation (signals, confidence)
        → FoundationModel.adapt() (on-device, uses private data)
          → Final personalized recommendation
```

**AI segments and input bands:**

| Band | Values | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| age_band | 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+ | UserProfile |
| gender_band | male, female, prefer_not_to_say | UserProfile |
| bmi_band | <18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, 30+ | Computed |
| active_weeks_band | 0, 1-3, 4+ | DailyLog history |
| program_phase | foundation, build, peak, recovery | UserProfile |
| sleep_band | under_6, 6-7, 7-8, 8+ | HealthKit/manual |
| resting_hr_band | under_60, 60-70, 71-80, 81+ | HealthKit/manual |
| stress_level | low, moderate, high | Derived |

**Current state & gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Foundation Model is placeholder | Medium | Uses rule-based adjustments; real LLM pending iOS 26 SDK |
| No recommendation UI | High | Signals exist but no dedicated UI to surface them to users |
| No A/B testing | Low | Can't test recommendation effectiveness |
| No user feedback loop | Medium | Users can't rate recommendation quality |

**Success metrics:**
- Recommendation acceptance rate (% of recommendations acted upon)
- Average confidence score per segment
- Cloud vs fallback ratio (% of requests served by cloud vs local)
- Escalation rate (% of recommendations that escalate to LLM)

**Key files:**
- `FitTracker/AI/AIOrchestrator.swift` (153 lines)
- `FitTracker/AI/AIEngineClient.swift` (85 lines)
- `FitTracker/AI/AITypes.swift` — AISegment, AIRecommendation, AIRecommendationSet, LocalUserSnapshot
- `FitTracker/AI/AISnapshotBuilder.swift` — builds snapshot from live data
- `FitTracker/AI/FoundationModelService.swift` — on-device LLM adapter
