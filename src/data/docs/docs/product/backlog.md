## Backlog (Unscheduled — from gap reviews and PRD)

### Critical (GDPR/Legal)
- [x] Account deletion (GDPR Article 17 — right to erasure) ✅ Shipped 2026-04-04
- [x] Data export (GDPR Article 20 — right to portability) ✅ Shipped 2026-04-04

### High Priority (Product Gaps)
- [x] AI recommendation UI — shipped 2026-04-10 (Home AIInsightCard + AIIntelligenceSheet) ✅
- [x] Food database search — OpenFoodFacts text search is wired in MealEntrySheet ✅
- [x] Barcode scanning — camera scanner is wired to OpenFoodFacts lookup in MealEntrySheet ✅
- [x] Auth runtime verification — Supabase consolidated to project `hwbbdzwaismlajtfsbed`, Google OAuth configured, email+Google auth providers enabled. Onboarding auth flow embedded (PR #80). Session restore fixed. Remaining: Apple Sign In (needs Services ID).
- [x] **Onboarding v2 Auth Flow** — SHIPPED 2026-04-15 (PR #80 + post-merge fixes). 7-step onboarding with embedded auth, success animation, session restore fix, Figma PDF icon, pinned CTAs, skip-for-now. Case study: `docs/case-studies/onboarding-v2-auth-flow-v5.1-case-study.md`
- [ ] **Smart Reminders System** — AI-powered local notification system with 5 reminder types: HealthKit connect, account registration, goal-gap nutrition (computes real-time macro gaps), training/rest day, engagement. Wired into AIOrchestrator + ReadinessEngine + GoalProfile for personalized, state-aware messaging. Locked feature overlays for guest users. Future sub-task: behavioral learning layer. ~5 days. Parent: onboarding-v2-auth-flow.
- [ ] Push notifications — research active in `.claude/features/push-notifications/` and Linear `FIT-23`
- [ ] App icon + App Store assets — research active in `.claude/features/app-store-assets/` and Linear `FIT-17`
- [x] Password reset flow — reset action is available from email login when Supabase runtime credentials are configured ✅
- [ ] **Import Training Plan from External Sources** — research active in `.claude/features/import-training-plan/` and Linear `FIT-24`. Allow users to bring existing training plans from other apps (Hevy, Strong, Fitbod, Jefit), spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel, Numbers), PDFs (coach programs, published programs like 531, PPL, nSuns), photos (gym whiteboard, handwritten plan), **or AI-generated plans from other assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, custom GPTs, coach bots)**. Must parse exercises, sets, reps, rest periods, RPE targets, and program structure (day splits, phases, progression rules). Key challenge: map external exercise names to FitMe's 87-exercise library with a confirmation/mapping UI for ambiguous matches. Supports: (1) CSV/JSON import, (2) PDF text extraction (already have OCR for nutrition), (3) photo OCR for handwritten/printed plans, (4) direct app-to-app share extension, (5) paste-to-parse from chat/email, (6) **AI conversation paste** — user pastes a full ChatGPT/Claude conversation or just the training plan section, and the parser extracts the structured plan (handles markdown tables, numbered lists, prose descriptions, code blocks). Also supports importing the original **prompt** used to generate the plan so users can regenerate/iterate with FitMe's AI engine using their preferred structure. Mapping must be progressive — easy matches auto-accept, ambiguous ones prompt the user. Once imported, plan replaces or supplements the default 6-day PPL split. Feature work type with full 10-phase lifecycle (0-9) required.
- [x] **Onboarding flow** — shipped 2026-04-07 (v2 UX alignment per ux-foundations.md, 6 screens including Consent, full GA4 instrumentation, PR #59)

### High Priority (Architecture & Framework)

- [x] **v5.1 Adaptive Batch Execution** — IMPLEMENTED 2026-04-14. 8/8 SoC items shipped in skill-routing.json v4.1 + pm-workflow/SKILL.md: batch dispatch (TPU weight-stationary), model tiering (ANE mixed-precision), result forwarding (UMA zero-copy), speculative preload (branch prediction), systolic chains (TPU systolic array), task complexity gate (big.LITTLE hybrid). ~63% framework overhead reduction.
- [x] **HADF Hardware-Aware Dispatch** (PR #82, 2026-04-16) — 5-layer hardware-aware dispatch extension: device detection, static profiles (17 chips), cloud fingerprinting (7 signatures), dynamic adaptation, evolutionary learning. Confidence-gated (0.4/0.7), zero regression. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-hadf-hardware-aware-dispatch-design.md`
- [ ] **Expand HADF signature library + further chip research (added 2026-04-28)** — HADF currently ships with 17 static chip profiles + 7 cloud signatures (PR #82, 2026-04-16). Backlog item to expand both: (1) add more Apple Silicon variants (M5/M6 generations as released, iPad/Vision Pro chips, A18+ family detail), more Snapdragon/Tensor/Exynos profiles for the Android port, more datacenter SKUs (H200, B100/B200, MI300X, MI325X, Trainium2, TPU v6), and emerging RISC-V AI accelerators (per `research_riscv_ai_accelerator_landscape.md`). (2) Deepen the cloud-fingerprinting heuristics — current 7 signatures are coarse; investigate finer-grained signals (NUMA topology, memory bandwidth probe, instruction-mix benchmarks, container vs bare-metal detection). (3) Research what's changed in the chip landscape since 2026-04-16 — new architectural primitives (e.g. dataflow accelerators, in-memory compute, photonic) that map to new dispatch principles beyond the current 7 SoC-on-software principles. Output: spec + delta PR against `.claude/shared/hardware-profiles.json` + updated cloud signature heuristics + a research note documenting which new chips/principles unlock which framework dispatch behaviors. Coordinate with `project_hadf_research.md` memory.
- [ ] **Expand ORCHID research + map current framework version capabilities back into ORCHID (added 2026-04-28)** — ORCHID (open-source AI orchestration accelerator, repo `github.com/Regevba/orchid`) completed its initial research with 6 experiments / 26K+ runs and a published case study. Since then the framework has advanced through v6.0 → v7.1 → v7.5 → v7.6 → v7.7 with new capabilities that did not exist when ORCHID's design space was explored. Backlog item to: (1) extend ORCHID's experiment suite — additional configurations beyond the original 26K runs, broader hardware coverage (overlap with HADF expansion above), and new design-space dimensions surfaced by recent framework work (e.g. write-time mechanical gates, validity-closure feedback loops, T1/T2/T3 measurement tiers). (2) Audit each current framework capability (v6.0 deterministic measurement, v7.1 72h integrity cycle, v7.5 cooperating-defenses model, v7.6 mechanical enforcement promotion, v7.7 validity closure + advisory gates) and ask: does ORCHID's silicon-layer mapping benefit from this software-layer advance? Concretely: can the integrity-cycle pattern map to a hardware self-audit primitive? Can the write-time gate model map to a hardware validation pipeline? Can the advisory-vs-mandatory gate distinction inform soft/hard accelerator assertion modes? (3) Output: a "framework→ORCHID v2 mapping" doc updating `research_framework_to_hardware_mapping.md`, plus a prioritized list of ORCHID experiments to run with the new principles, plus a recommendation on whether ORCHID's hardware spec should bump to a v2 design. Coordinate with `research_cloud_emulated_chip_design.md` and `research_orchid_design_space_findings.md` memories.
- [ ] **Sentry Error Tracking Integration** — No crash reporting wired. High priority before App Store launch. Sentry adapter at `.claude/integrations/sentry/` exists but no MCP connected. Unlocks real crash-free rate for `/ops health`, crash correlation for `/cx analyze`, and live data for Phase 0 health check `shared_layer_consistency`.
- [ ] **Funnel Analysis Dashboards** — GA4 event taxonomy is in place and `/analytics funnel` can define funnels, but no GA4 dashboards have been built. Blocks PRD kill criteria evaluation and Phase 9 (Learn) with real conversion data.
- [ ] **`/ops digest` — Stakeholder Updates** — Weekly project health summary aggregating health-status.json, cx-signals.json, metric-status.json, and change-log.json. Automates Phase 9 monitoring cadence instead of manual `/cx analyze` + `/analytics report`.
- [ ] **Refine case-study presentation/readability (added 2026-04-28)** — The case-study corpus is 47+ documents and growing. Latest entries (v7.5, v7.6, v7.7) trend toward dense, multi-section, paragraph-heavy formats with deeply-nested headings (Section 99.1 through 99.8 in v7.7). The CONTENT is solid but the PRESENTATION is dense. Goals: (1) standardize a top-of-document summary card that reads in <60s and captures version + outcome + 3 key numbers + 2 honest disclosures; (2) extract a cross-case-study comparison table (every case study at a glance — version, work_type, wall_time, CU, primary_outcome — auto-generated from frontmatter); (3) consolidate the dual outlet (FitTracker2 long-form + fitme-story slot MDX) into a clear short/long pattern with a one-paragraph diff between the two; (4) introduce visual hierarchy markers (callout boxes for outlier-flag, kill-criterion-fired, deferred-items) so readers can skim by skimming structure not text; (5) audit the v2.0–v7.0 timeline studies for the same readability standard (currently they're inconsistent). NOT a content rewrite — purely a presentation/readability refactor. Coordinate with `/design` skill for the visual-hierarchy markers in the fitme-story rendering layer.
- [x] **Framework glossary + non-dev "how the dev process works" primer (added + shipped 2026-04-28)** — Two deliverables. (1) **Framework glossary** — extended the canonical glossary at `fitme-story/src/lib/glossary.ts` with 16 new entries covering v7.5–v7.7 vocabulary: data-quality-tiers (T1/T2/T3), class-a-b-c, gate-timing (write-time / cycle-time / readout-time), pre-commit-hook, integrity-cycle (72h), cooperating-defenses (v7.5), mechanical-enforcement (v7.6), validity-closure (v7.7), advisory-gate, backfill, integrity-check-code, kill-criterion, control-room, dispatch-replay, audit-tiers, stacked-pr. 30 → 46 entries; renders at [fitme-story.vercel.app/glossary](https://fitme-story.vercel.app/glossary). Did NOT create a duplicate `docs/glossary.md` in FitTracker2 — the fitme-story TS glossary is the canonical one; FitTracker2 cross-links to it from CLAUDE.md Key Paths. (2) **Non-dev dev-process primer** at [`docs/glossary-dev-basics.md`](glossary-dev-basics.md) — 18+ terms (repo, clone, branch, main, HEAD, commit, diff, push, pull, merge, rebase, conflict, PR, worktree, CI, pre-commit hook, GitHub Actions workflow, grep, echo, make, xcodebuild, stash) plus end-to-end "how a feature reaches Done" walkthrough. Cross-linked from CLAUDE.md Key Paths and `docs/skills/README.md`. **Pending follow-up:** codify maintenance contract (glossary entries added in the same PR that introduces the term, similar to tokens) into CLAUDE.md as a project rule.

### High Priority (Architecture → AI Engine)
- [x] **AI Engine v2 — Adapt PM v4.0 Architecture for AIOrchestrator** — SHIPPED 2026-04-15 (PR #79). 4-phase implementation: input adapters, confidence gate + goal-aware intelligence, learning cache, feedback UI + analytics. 17 files, 986 insertions, 197 tests pass. Case study: `docs/case-studies/ai-engine-architecture-v5.1-case-study.md` — research active in `.claude/features/ai-engine-architecture-adaptation/` and Linear `FIT-25`. Study how the reactive data mesh (adapter layer → validation gate → shared layer → cache), pattern recognition (L1/L2/L3 learning cache), and cross-domain data flow architecture built for the PM skill ecosystem can enhance the in-app AI engine (AIOrchestrator). Investigate: (1) micro-analysis on-device (pattern recognition from local HealthKit/training/nutrition data using the same cache + validation principles), (2) macro-analysis via cloud (foundation model calls enriched by cached user patterns, similar to how skills use cached patterns to skip derivation), (3) adapter-style integration for health data sources (Garmin, Whoop, Oura → normalize → validate → feed AI), (4) validation gate concept for AI recommendations (confidence scoring before surfacing to user), (5) learning cache for AI — store what recommendations worked per user profile to improve over time. Goal: make the AI engine as data-driven and self-improving as the PM workflow.

### Medium Priority (UX Improvements)
- [ ] Chart goal target lines — weight/BF goals not overlaid on stats charts
