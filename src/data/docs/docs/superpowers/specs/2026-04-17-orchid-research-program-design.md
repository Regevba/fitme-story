## Section 1: What We're Building

A comprehensive Python-level research program producing 6 experiments and 2 case study documents, positioning Orchid as the natural evolution of the FitMe PM framework's SoC-on-Software research thread.

### Deliverables

1. **Real trace dataset** — convert all v6.0+ feature state.json files into Orchid traces
2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis** — quantified parameter importance with interaction effects
3. **Architectural ablation study** — remove each unit, measure composite score impact
4. **Multi-feature parallel traces** — stress U4 batch scheduling (gap from initial findings)
5. **Property-based stress testing** — 25,000 runs across randomized configs + traces
6. **Software vs hardware latency comparison** — theoretical speedup table

### Case Study Documents

- **Full:** FitTracker2 `docs/case-studies/orchid-ai-accelerator-case-study.md` — standard template, 10 sections, academic rigor + framework narrative
- **Condensed:** Orchid repo `docs/case-study.md` — standalone research summary linking back to full version

### Audience

Both academic/portfolio and framework evolution narrative. The case study stands alone for academic purposes but also slots into the FitMe story as the endpoint of SoC-on-Software → HADF → Orchid.

## Section 2: Research Program — 6 Experiments

### Experiment 1: Real Trace Dataset

**Goal:** Convert every v6.0+ feature's `state.json` + `cache-hits.json` into Orchid `.jsonl` traces and replay through the pipeline.

**Sources:** `.claude/features/*/state.json` (features with `timing` data from v6.0 instrumentation). Expected 5-15 real traces from completed features (framework-measurement-v6, meta-analysis-audit, smart-reminders, dispatch-intelligence, parallel-write-safety, etc.).

**Method:** Run `trace_converter.py` on each feature directory, feed output through `trace_replayer.py`, save results.

**Deliverable:** Real-world benchmark dataset. These are ground truth — synthetic traces validate architecture, real traces validate relevance.

### Experiment 2: Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

**Goal:** Quantify which OrchidConfig parameter matters most, including interaction effects.

**Method:** Latin hypercube sampling across the full parameter space:
- `cache_entries`: [3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30]
- `max_concurrent`: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
- `prefetch_ahead`: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- `prediction_table_size`: [8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
- `queue_depth`: [8, 16, 32, 64]

200 random configurations sampled from this space. Each config runs against all synthetic + real traces. Measure composite score variance attributable to each parameter (one-at-a-time sensitivity index) and pairwise interaction effects.

**Deliverable:** Ranked parameter importance table — e.g. "cache_entries explains 47% of score variance, prefetch_ahead explains 31%, everything else < 5%." Pairwise interaction heatmap.

### Experiment 3: Architectural Ablation Study

**Goal:** Prove which units are load-bearing vs nice-to-have by removing them one at a time.

**Ablations:**

| Ablation | What It Tests |
|---|---|
| Remove U3 (cache) | Pipeline with no caching — every lookup is a miss |
| Remove U4 (batch) | No grouping — tasks dispatch in arrival order |
| Remove U5 (prefetch) | No speculation — cache only warms from direct hits |
| Remove U6 (coherence) | No write coordination — measure corruption risk |
| Remove U3+U5 | No memory hierarchy — pure compute pipeline |
| Baseline (all units) | Full Orchid pipeline |

**Method:** Create `AblatedOrchestrator` variants that skip specific units. Run each against all traces. Measure composite score delta vs baseline.

**Deliverable:** Ablation table with per-unit contribution. Column: ablation name, composite score, delta vs baseline, % degradation, cache hit rate, corruption count.

### Experiment 4: Multi-Feature Parallel Traces

**Goal:** Stress U4 batch scheduling with realistic parallel workloads (gap from initial findings where `max_concurrent` had zero impact).

**Traces to generate:**

| Trace | Description |
|---|---|
| `parallel_2_features.jsonl` | 2 features interleaved, realistic phase sequences |
| `parallel_4_features.jsonl` | 4 features (v5.1 stress test scenario) |
| `parallel_8_features.jsonl` | 8 features (saturation at max_concurrent=8) |

Each feature follows a realistic phase sequence (research→prd→tasks→implement→test→review→merge) offset in time, with events interleaved by timestamp.

**Deliverable:** Proves whether U4's tier grouping provides measurable throughput improvement. Expected: parallel_8 should show batch scheduling benefit when tasks from different features arrive simultaneously.

### Experiment 5: Property-Based Stress Testing

**Goal:** Prove architectural robustness across the entire parameter + trace space.

**Method:** Generate 500 random OrchidConfig configurations and 50 random trace sequences. Run every config against every trace (25,000 runs). Assert invariants:

| Invariant | Unit | Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Score range | U1 | `0 <= score <= 100` for all inputs |
| Routing completeness | U2 | `len(skills) >= 1` for all phases |
| Cache monotonicity | U3 | Hit rate non-decreasing in steady state |
| No corruption | U6 | `corruption_count == 0` under random access |
| Positive score | Metrics | `composite_score > 0` for non-empty traces |

**Deliverable:** 25,000 test runs. Any invariant violation = bug to fix. Zero violations = architecture is robust for RTL.

### Experiment 6: Software vs Hardware Latency Comparison

**Goal:** Quantify the theoretical speedup of Orchid over the software framework.

**Method:**
1. From real traces (Exp 1), extract `latency_ms` (actual PM framework dispatch time from v6.0 timing)
2. From Orchid pipeline, extract `total_cycles` for the same decisions
3. Assume 1 GHz clock → `orchid_latency_ns = total_cycles`
4. Speedup = `software_latency_ms * 1e6 / orchid_latency_ns`

**Caveats (documented in case study):**
- This is a theoretical upper bound, not a measured RTL speed
- Python cycle counts model the architecture, not the actual hardware timing
- Real speedup requires Verilator validation (Phase 2+)
- The comparison is dispatch overhead only, not end-to-end AI inference

**Deliverable:** Speedup table per feature with confidence interval. Expected: orders of magnitude (software dispatches in milliseconds, hardware in nanoseconds).
